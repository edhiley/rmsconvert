    <description>Document providing good practice measures to improve service provision in access to genitourinary medicine.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;The implementation of strategies for integrated local sexual health service development takes time, and progress varies around the country. In the future, sexual health services will be provided in a range of hospital and community settings and people will be able to choose where to go for treatment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This document recognises that aspects of sexual health service development involve a broader focus and that the use of alternative settings will help to reduce demand upon genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Case studies within the High Impact Changes highlight the importance of making better use of community contraceptive services. The document recognises that, in order to alleviate pressure, Level 2 GUM should be developed to support the testing and treating of existing patients. Such an approach demonstrates the role of other sexual health services in the community as a stepping stone to achieving this strategy in addition to preventing further unnecessary demand for GUM.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Some of this may demand a wider approach for long-term improvements to sexual health, such as the introduction of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman size=1&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;and reducing Teenage Pregnancies.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman size=1&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;However, the focus of this document is upon the rapid improvement of access to GUM services. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;These High Impact Changes provide measures that can be implemented quickly and on a scale that will enable 48-hour access to a local GUM service by March 2008. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;For many primary care trusts (PCTs), the changes likely to have the greatest and quickest impact on achieving the target will be within existing GUM services. The measures included in this document reflect good practice. They are not mandatory but where trusts implement them, they will both increase efficiency and enable progress towards the GUM access target.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report is for public service leaders, commissioners and all concerned with spending public money and delivering effective public services. Public services are facing a number of complex challenges such as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;meeting increasing and more complex needs of service users and communities 
&lt;LI&gt;living within increasingly constrained budgets, both in terms of revenue and capital, during a possible period of recession 
&lt;LI&gt;reconciling competing priorities for scarce resources 
&lt;LI&gt;ensuring environmental sustainability in delivering services 
&lt;LI&gt;coping with a complex and often changing set of policies and priorities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The way in which the public sector commissions services could help to meet these challenges. In theory, intelligent commissioning can tap into resources that already exist in the community, to create more value for the users of a service, the wider public and environment, as well as for the public purse.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A key objective of this report is to encourage public service leaders to develop an enabling institutional framework for intelligent commissioning.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P align=left&gt;This framework sets out how self care support fits with existing commissioning approaches and some additional techniques that may be less familiar. The framework starts with a definition of self care and how this affects the way we commission, with the patient as co-provider. The framework comprises a set of steps, many familiar to commissioners but some new. There are additional sections on building momentum, where the value of self care support is not fully recognised and on designing and adapting to make sure that existing programmes and initiatives are considered in the commissioning process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guide is organised around a process of involvement in commissioning. There are four broad stages in the process:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;gathering evidence of need&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;contracting with providers&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;managing contracts&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;evaluation and feedback&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Real examples from the practice of commissioning are provided to illustrate each stage of the process.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;In the summer of 2008, a group of patients were convened by a small practice-based commissioning consortium called Hertsmere Commissioning Ltd in Hertfordshire, in order to bring the voice of patients and the public to their commissioning decision making. This group was supported initially by the West Hertfordshire Primary Care Trust. A member of the core team at the NHS Centre for Involvement was also there to support the group and the idea of the guide was born.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Further contacts through organisational development work across the country identified good practice in involvement in practice-based commissioning going on in other parts of the country and in particular in Newcastle, West Sussex and Leeds and the team was able to identify good practice through an entry made to the Involvement Awards by NHS Salford. This document represents the outcomes of the Hertsmere work and material generated from other areas.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

It is particularly relevant for local authority staff and for other public bodies, including children’s trusts that are organising services for children and young people; drug action teams and crime and disorder reduction partnerships; regeneration and local area agreement partnerships; and,&amp;nbsp;social care and healthcare commissioners for older people or those with a learning or physical disability or mental health problem. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

This report looks at why the courts, probation and health services rarely use the MHTR.

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intelligent customer insight&lt;/STRONG&gt; - ensure effective and consistent use of data better to know the profile of the diversity of the communities they serve;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service design&lt;/STRONG&gt; - involve local people, particularly those in most need, in designing services around their needs;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Personalisation&lt;/STRONG&gt; - create individual budgets and provide multiple needs through one integrated service;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prevention&lt;/STRONG&gt; - make prevention a mainstream&amp;nbsp;activity at the heart of the commissioning process;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partnerships - &lt;/STRONG&gt;make partnership work for users rather than creating talking shops and further bureaucracy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This review finds that although collaborative procurement has the potential to improve value for money, the public sector procurement landscape is fragmented, with no overall governance. It recommends that, given the size of public sector procurement spend and the potential to significantly improve value for money, public bodies should work together much more effectively than they currently do and there should be a clear framework to coordinate public sector procurement activity.</description>

    <description>This report reviews the circumstances around deaths in patients with haemoglobinopathies - sickle cell disease and thalassaemia - in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Offshore Islands.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Haemoglobinopathy care in the UK is changing substantially. There is now a neonatal screening programme in England and national guidelines for clinical care in adults are being developed. Patient care is becoming more focused on the prevention of complications and the Department of Health is facilitating the development of regional networks for paediatric haemoglobinopathies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There have been periodic limited surveys of morbidity and mortality for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia patients in the UK, but no previous national survey and none with casenote review. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;NCEPOD believed it was timely to review the mortality related to the haemoglobinopathies in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Offshore Islands, to identify specific remediable factors for these particular diseases.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report makes ten principal recommendations related to the understanding of these diseases, vaccination and antibiotics, multidisciplinary and multi-agency approaches to the management of the diseases, access to protocols and guidance, the evaluation of cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease, and the development of a national database of patients with haemoglobinopathies.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This document sets out a framework for creating a stronger local voice in the development of health and social care services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The arrangements for involving patients and the public are being updated to support the changes being made to the health and social care systems. The new arrangements aim to build on the work of patient forums and the involvement activities of individuals, groups and networks and to strengthen and widen the way in which people's views are gathered, listened to and taken account of when health and social care services are planned, developed and commissioned.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;They will allow for ways of working that meet the needs and preferences of local people and create capacity for an independent voice at a local level in commissioning health and care services, assessing the quality of services provided and in the regulation of the health and social care system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) and patient forums will be abolished and local involvement networks (LINks) will be established for every local authority area with social services responsibilities. These networks will be able to provide flexible ways for communities to engage with health and social care organisations in ways that best suit the communities and the people in them. They will build on the work of patient forums by creating a strengthened system of user involvement and will promote public accountability in health and social care through open and transparent communication with commissioners and providers. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;LINks will establish a specific relationship with overview and scrutiny committees (OSCs) and have the power to refer matters to the OSCs. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;OSCs will be encouraged to focus their attention on the work of commissioners of health and social care services and are ideally placed to ask commissioners about the decisions they have made. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The duties to involve and consult will be simplified and strengthened. There will be a new duty placed on commissioners to respond to what patients and the public have said. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Work is being undertaken to explore ways of creating a stronger voice for patients, service users and members of the public at a national level.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;There will be a stronger user voice in regulation and in the regulation of involvement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This paper describes the use of the Markov Monte Carlo simulation model for forecasting coronary artery revascularisation procedures.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;H4&gt;Abstract&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Background.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Treatments for coronary heart disease (CHD) have evolved rapidly over the last 15 years with considerable change in the number and effectiveness of both medical and surgical treatments. This period has seen the rapid development and uptake of statin drugs and coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs) that include Coronary Artery Bypass Graft procedures (CABGs) and Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs). It is difficult in an era of such rapid change to accurately forecast requirements for treatment services such as CARPs. In a previous paper we have described and outlined the use of a Markov Monte Carlo simulation model for analyzing and predicting the requirements for CARPs for the population of Western Australia (Mannan et al, 2007). In this paper, we expand on the use of this model for forecasting CARPs in Western Australia with a focus on the lack of adequate performance of the (standard) model for forecasting CARPs in a period during the mid 1990s when there were considerable changes to CARP technology and implementation policy and an exploration and demonstration of how the standard model may be adapted to achieve better performance 
&lt;H4&gt;Methods&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Selected key CARP event model probabilities are modified based on information relating to changes in the effectiveness of CARPs from clinical trial evidence and an awareness of trends in policy and practice of CARPs. These modified model probabilities and the ones obtained by standard methods are used as inputs in our Markov simulation model.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H4&gt;Results&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The projected numbers of CARPs in the population of Western Australia over 1995–99 only improve marginally when modifications to model probabilities are made to incorporate an increase in effectiveness of PCI procedures. However, the projected numbers improve substantially when, in addition, further modifications are incorporated that relate to the increased probability of a PCI procedure and the reduced probability of a CABG procedure stemming from changed CARP preference following the introduction of PCI operations involving stents.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is often knowledge and sometimes quantitative evidence of the expected impacts of changes in surgical practice and procedure effectiveness and these may be used to improve forecasts of future requirements for CARPs in a population.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Procurement guidance.
[No publication date available]</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Recent developments in public sector procurement have raised questions about the extent to which organisations should pool requirements and let fewer and larger contracts. The efficiency agenda is driving towards reducing procurement costs, making use of combined influence as buyers and achieving economies of scale. However there are also increasing concerns about the role of small firms in a competitive and healthy market, and the fact that in some markets a small number of suppliers is able to exert an undue influence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guidance is designed to inform decision making during the development of organisational procurement strategies, and during the strategic planning stage prior to a programme or project. It aims to clarify what is meant by the term 'aggregation'; identifes the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with it; and discusses the key issues that will inform the decision-making process.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A qualitative study of GPs views on their role in supporting patient choice.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Extending patient choice is one of several levers in the government’s programme to modernise the NHS as it strives to create a more personalised, responsive and efficient health service. This paper presents the findings of a small qualitative study exploring GPs’ views about their role in supporting patient choice at the point of referral. In particular, it focuses on GPs’ level of support for patient choice and the influences on their referral behaviour; GPs’ early experiences of Choose and Book; the information that GPs need to inform patients about choice; and the impact of patient characteristics on equity in choice.]]&gt;</body>

It is part of the government’s agenda to create a revolution for patients - “putting patients first” - giving people more information and control and greater choice about their care.&amp;nbsp; The information revolution is about transforming the way information is accessed, collected, analysed and used so that people are at the heart of health and adult social care services. The Department of Health is consulting on the proposals laid out in An information revolution. The consultation will close on 14 January 2011.]]&gt;</body>

This is a key element of Joint Strategic Needs Assessment as set out in the Department’s Commissioning Framework for Health and Well-Being. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The approach uses interviews with service users and focus groups with people aged 60-65. The toolkit includes a step-by-step guide, an interview template and a focus group script. A structured reporting format using the results of the research facilitates reporting of local results, comparison between councils and the building of a knowledge base of evidence.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance for commissioners and resource for providers will assist in developing a shared approach in achieving an improved quality of life for stroke survivors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guidance is about whole system commissioning and recognises that achieving excellence across the whole service is challenging, will not be immediate and that one size does not fit all. World Class Commissioning is about expecting excellence and evidence suggests there are unacceptable variations in services for stroke survivors. The guidance also recognises the potential within the system and that a courageous approach is needed to really make a difference, viewing the pathway as a ‘year of care’ to optimise opportunities for ‘adding life to years, and years to life’ of stroke survivors.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Equalities is a major part of service improvement and modifying services to be flexible, appropriate and tailored to meet community needs. This Equality Impact Assessment (EqIA) guidance helps commissioners by:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Establishing the standards required to demonstrate compliance with equality legislation.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Specifying the patient data that commissioners need in order to inform both a business case and service plans for psychological therapies.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identifying groups that are protected under equality legislation and the social determinants, which increase prevalence of depression or anxiety.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Improving or maintaining equitable accessibility, notably regarding providing information and language use.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Supporting integrated training plans and embedding cultural competence in competency frameworks and contract monitoring.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Providing information and assistance on assessing equality of access and outcome within IAPT services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The guidance has been developed to achieve the following outcomes:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Equality promotion and discrimination tackled at various levels&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved understanding of equality duties and groups protected by legislation&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Greater awareness of the mental health needs of protected groups&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Reduction in stigma experienced by patients and service users&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Improved strategies for co-morbidity of physical and mental health&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>10 steps a commissioner can take to realise the enefits of Better Care, Better Value Indicators.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Better Care, Better Value (BCBV) indicators reveal the potential to make significant cash or resource savings whilst improving quality. Two guides have been published which contain ten steps that organisations can take to use the BCBV indicators to maximum effect to improve quality and increase productivity. One is aimed at NHS &lt;A href="http://www.institute.nhs.uk/images//documents/BCBV%20For%20Commissioners.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;commissioners&lt;/A&gt; and the other is for &lt;A href="http://www.institute.nhs.uk/images//documents/BCBV%20For%20Providers.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;provider organisations&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Better Care, Better Value indicators website provides information on the indicators and the overall programme. The indicators are supported by a web-based tool, NHS indicator explorer, which has been developed in partnership with the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, the Department of Health and Dr Foster Intelligence. To download the NHS indicators or for more information go to: &lt;A href="http://www.productivity.nhs.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;www.productivity.nhs.uk&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This joint paper by the Nuffield Trust and the NHS Alliance examines how PBC can be developed. While there may be many ways this could happen, this paper considers one broad model – that of multi-specialty groups of clinicians – for example GPs as well as hospital-based specialists – taking responsibility for the provision and commissioning of local healthcare.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Practice-based commissioning (PBC) has been a cornerstone of the government’s health service reforms in England since it was introduced in 2005, but it has so far had limited success. With the NHS about to enter a period in which growth in its budget will be severely constrained, it is vital that clinicians, especially doctors, are engaged in decisions about how patient services are designed and delivered and how NHS money is spent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This joint paper by the Nuffield Trust and the NHS Alliance examines how PBC can be developed. While there may be many ways this could happen, this paper considers one broad model – that of multi-specialty groups of clinicians – for example GPs as well as hospital-based specialists – taking responsibility for the provision and commissioning of local healthcare.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper has been informed by a series of interviews and two workshops held with clinicians and managers active within PBC, academics, and policy-makers expert in this area. In these interviews, people were asked about their views of the role and potential for groups of clinicians to assume responsibility for health provision and commissioning in the NHS. As context to the study, a review of the research and policy literature on physician groups, multi-specialty groups and primary care organisations was undertaken, including material from the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The 2006 White Paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services describes the Government’s vision for shifting health and social care further into the community. The aim is to encourage people to live independently and to exercise greater personal choice by providing more flexibility, accessibility, timely interventions, and care closer to people’s homes. These changes require a significant ‘shift’ in the way care is delivered, away from care provided in specialist settings towards responsive community based services. The vision calls for more than simply changing the location where care is delivered; it is also about changing attitudes and behaviour among all stakeholders.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Little research attention has been given to attempts to implement organisational initiatives to improve quality of care for mental health care, where there is a high level of indeterminacy and clinical judgements are often contestable. This paper explores recent efforts made at an organisational level in England to improve the quality of primary care for people with mental health problems through the new institutional process of 'clinical governance'. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It finds that despite some achievements in regard to monitoring and standardisation of prescribing practice, mental health care in primary care seems to have so far largely eluded the gaze of 'clinical governance'. It makes some policy recommendations and suggests other contexts to which the findings might apply.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Journal of Health Services Research and Policy 14 (4): October.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Objectives: Developments in genetic knowledge and clinical applications are seen as rendering traditional modes of organizing genetics provision increasingly inappropriate. In common with a number of developed world countries the UK has sought to increase the role of primary care in delivering such services. However, efforts to reconfigure service delivery face multiple challenges associated with divergent policy objectives, organizational boundaries and professional cultures. This paper presents findings from an evaluation of an English initiative to integrate genetics into 'mainstream' clinical provision in the National Health Service. Methods: Qualitative research in 11 case-study sites focusing on attempts by pilots funded by the initiative to embed knowledge and provision within primary care illustrating barriers faced and the ways in which these were surmounted. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Results: Lack of intrinsic interest in clinical genetics among primary care staff was compounded by national targets that focused their attention elsewhere and by service structures that rendered genetics a peripheral concern demanding minimal engagement. Established divisions between the commissioning of mainstream and specialist services, along with the pressures of shorter-term targets, impeded ongoing funding. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Conclusions: More wide-ranging policy and organizational support is required if the aim of entrenching genetics knowledge and practice across the Health Service is to be realized.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This evaluation assessed the benefits of enabling lead professionals to control budgets for commissioning / purchasing support services for children and young people with additional needs and looks at the costs of establishing BHLP practice and its impact on resource use.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;In 2006, pilots were established in a variety of locations in England to allow lead professionals (LPs) working with children and young people with additional needs to hold budgets and commission services tailored to each child’s needs. A multidisciplinary team of researchers at Newcastle University was selected to undertake the national evaluation of the budget-holding lead professional (BHLP) pilots between 2006 and 2008.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This evaluation assessed the benefits of enabling lead professionals to control budgets for commissioning / purchasing support services for children and young people with additional needs and looks at the costs of establishing BHLP practice and its impact on resource use. The study analysed the cost-effectiveness of BHLP practice and described the operation of the programme and determined whether particular contexts influence its effectiveness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report is written primarily for policymakers and practitioners who are interested in the minutiae of the evaluation. It contains eleven chapters and the more technical detail is contained in Annexes 1 and 2.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The evaluation involved analysis of case level data on children and young people from 16 BHLP pilots and 2 non-BHLP LAs. E-surveys of BHLPs and managers and in-depth interviews with children, young people, parents and practitioners in 3 case study pilots were carried out. Multi-agency working in 2 BHLP pilots was examined.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;In the drive towards world class commissioning, effectively communicating change that will translate into action is essential. As PCTs work to address the healthcare needs of their populations and prioritise strategic aims and objectives, they must involve stakeholders at all levels, and in all areas if they wish to reach their intended goals within the required timeframe. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This white paper is one of a series that will discuss the critical importance of engaging stakeholders to help deliver strategic objectives; it includes valuable insight into commercial best practices on communication that could equally apply to anyone involved in running an efficient healthcare system. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;The majority of these currently hold several contracts with external organisations, with a quarter holding five or more contracts&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Most external support is procured outside of the Department of Health’s Framework for procuring External Support for Commissioning (FESC), which was designed to assist PCTs in using external support&lt;/LI&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This site is aimed at supporting World-class Commissioning of cancer services across the NHS by making information on cancer care in England freely available. It includes a range of high-level indicators, as well as a number of links to more detailed information, right across the patient’s journey: from prevention and screening through referral and treatment to living with and beyond cancer, as well as end of life care. 
&lt;P&gt;The CCT’s key features underline its usefulness and unique ability to support effective commissioning of cancer services:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;It centralises key commissioning information, providing easy access to standard (and regularly updated) data removing the need to navigate multiple and disparate systems 
&lt;LI&gt;It presents cancer datasets in an intuitive graphical manner with detailed guidance at chart level, assisting in the interpretation of complex variables and their wider implication 
&lt;LI&gt;It allows benchmarking of variables between comparable clusters, enabling performance comparisons and improvements 
&lt;LI&gt;It displays information at different levels of detail, for diff erent health economies, enabling high level assessments as well as in depth analysis of all key cancer topics, for example from a dashboard of key cancer variables viewable at PCT/Network level to analysis of Length of Stay (LOS) for specific procedures

    <description>At its first Policy Forum event in 2006, HFMA members and invited guests from around the NHS discussed turnaround and how it compared to earlier approaches to financial recovery in the NHS. The Forum concluded that it would be useful to pull together a series of case studies on turnaround to improve understanding of this ‘new’ approach to restoring financial balance and moving beyond into financial surplus. This collection of articles, based on interviews with finance directors in NHS trusts and foundation trusts, is the result of that meeting and aims to improve understanding of how different organisations have approached turnaround.

    <description>One in a series of seven papers on market facilitation.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This paper (fourth in the series) is based on a project managed by the Institute of Public Care that took place during 2007/08. The work initially focused on the development of an outcome-based approach to procuring services. Its aim was to provide a model by which authorities could move from a purchasing process based on buying a volume of provision, ie hours, days, beds etc, to a purchasing process based on a provider delivering a set of pre-determined outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Section A of this paper looks at how thinking about outcomes has gradually become more prominent in social care. Section B describes the work of the individual projects. Section C looks at how an outcomes approach might be implemented and how it can be integrated with the personalisation agenda.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;To meet national goals for reductions in emergency bed days and effective administration of practice-based commissioning, National Health Service (NHS) organisations have highlighted the need for tools to assess patient needs across the continuum of care. A risk stratification tool called the Combined Predictive Model (the Combined Model) has been developed to provide a rich segmentation of patients at each section of the continuum. The model is based on a comprehensive dataset of patient information, including inpatient (IP), outpatient (OP), and accident &amp;amp; emergency (A&amp;amp;E) data from secondary care sources as well as general practice (GP) electronic medical records.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Through identifying relative risk along the continuum, the Combined Model allows NHS organisations to develop and tailor intervention intensity to match the expected ‘returns’. Previously, this level of detail and stratification were unavailable to the NHS, but the Combined Model allows for development and implementation of these strategies across patient segments.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Commissioner level programme budgeting data is published annually in the form of a benchmarking tool that enables commissioners to identify:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how they spend their allocation over the 23 diseases and their respective subcategories;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how, and by how much, their expenditure distribution pattern compares with other commissioners nationally, locally or with similar characteristics and;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how their expenditure distribution has changed over time&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tool enables commissioners to benchmark expenditure for financial years 2006-07 to 2008-09 and also includes raw expenditure data for 2003-04 to 2005-06. To access the tool please save it to a local drive before opening. You will need WinZip or similar unzipping software to open the file.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P align=left&gt;Everyone in society has the right to make a difference within their local community, but some can be restricted by their mental health problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This document describes services that provide everyone with depression and anxiety disorders with access to the right treatment. It also sets out the learning so far from the demonstration sites.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;It is intended to be used to inform the development of a further 10 Pathfinder sites. Other commissioners who wish to review their current services and consider improvements to their services can also use it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The treatment should include the most modern forms of psychological therapies, which, as the evidence shows, can help the majority of those affected back to health.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This support should come about by providing easier access to better psychological therapies and support services at the time when they are required. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This document &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;does the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;sets out key service principles that define ‘Improving Access to Psychological Therapies’ for the Pathfinder sites;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;sets out a framework that describes how we can expand services to improve access to psychological therapies for the Pathfinder sites; &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;demonstrates how many sites across the country are already making a difference and improving people’s lives as a result.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This publication provides an introduction to commissioning for small and medium sized voluntary and community organisations working with children and young people. It focuses on these organisations because, due to their size and capacity, they may face challenges that make being involved in the process of commissioning particularly difficult. However, because of the nature of voluntary and community organisations, they can make a signifivant contribution to the aim of commissioning, which is to improve outcomes for local children, young people and families.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Handbook providing a detailed explanation of the content of commissioning assurance.  It also includes a practical guide on how to follow the process.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;FONT face=SyntaxLTStd-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The world class commissioning programme is designed to raise ambitions for a new form of commissioning that has not yet been developed or implemented in a comprehensive way anywhere in the world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;World class commissioning is about delivering better health and wellbeing for the population, improving health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. In partnership with local government, practice based commissioners and others, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), supported by Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs), will lead the NHS in turning the world class commissioning vision into a reality, adding life to years and years to life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The assurance system for world class commissioning (“commissioning assurance”) is linked to the vision and competencies published in December 2007 and to resources for support and development available both nationally and locally. Together these provide a coherent programme aimed at supporting commissioners in delivering their health agenda.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This handbook provides a detailed explanation of the content of commissioning assurance, with a practical guide on how to follow the process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;The Health Committee is asking witnesses about the impact and any unintended consequences of 'Payment by Results' on the NHS and commissioning, and in relation to 'Specialised Commissioning', will explore any weaknesses in the management and delivery of this complex area.&lt;/P&gt;

Accompanying the main guide is a shorter action guide for decision-makers which is aimed at directors of adult services, chief executives of primary care trusts and elected members. Key recommendations in the guides include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;think ‘carer’ in all commissioning and joint strategic needs assessments&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;improve outcomes, independence and choices for both carers and those they care for&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;involve carers of all groups and communities in decision-making and planning processes&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;strengthen the carer support provider market, using a variety of funding approaches&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Diabetes and Kidney Care Commissioning Guide has been developed by NHS Diabetes and NHS Kidney Care with key stakeholders including clinical and social services professionals and patient groups represented by Diabetes UK.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is not designed to replace the Standard NHS Contracts as many of the legal and contractual requirements have already been identified in this set of documents. Rather, it is intended to form the basis of a discussion or development of diabetes and kidney care services between commissioners and providers from which a contract for services can then be agreed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This commissioning guide consists of:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;A description of the key features of good diabetes and kidney care 
&lt;LI&gt;A high level intervention map. This intervention map describes the key high level actions or interventions (both clinical and administrative) 
&lt;LI&gt;diabetes and kidney care services should undertake in order to provide the most efficient and effective care, from admission to discharge (or death) from the service. It is not intended to be a care pathway or clinical protocol, rather it describes how a true ‘diabetes without walls’ service should operate going across the current sectors of health care. 
&lt;LI&gt;The intervention map may describe current service models or it may describe what should ideally be provided by diabetes and kidney care services. 
&lt;LI&gt;A diabetes and kidney care contracting framework that brings together all the key standards of quality and policy relating to diabetes and kidney care 
&lt;LI&gt;A template service specification for diabetes and kidney care services that forms part of schedule 2 of the Standard NHS Contract covering the key headings required of a specification. It is recommended that the commissioner checks which mandatory headings are required for each type of care as specified by the Standard NHS Contracts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Liverpool PCT Health Outcomes Team has developed an outcome-based approach to commissioning services that satisfies the requirements of the commissioning cycle. This process is known as the ABC approach to commissioning for outcomes. The framework has its foundations in the key elements of the commissioning cycle and therefore demonstrates how the cycle is utilised in practice. This paper discusses the framework in the context of the recent white paper.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This report looks at how smart commissioning will be vital to the success of social care reform and the personalisation of care services. It does not envisage that 'traditional' commissioning approaches will form more than a transitional role in ensuring this success. This paper considers that through personalisation, commissioning is both rejuvenated and wholly reformed.&amp;nbsp;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This report examines how personalization is reshaping public services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report examines how personalization is reshaping public services. It first takes stock of how far the personalization agenda has advanced, highlighting its penetration into a wide range of services and identifying common themes across these sectors. Second, the report reflects on the issues thrown up by the implementation of personalized public services, with a focus on commissioning as a key site of transformation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By taking stock of the development of personalization in England, part 1 of this report provides a benchmark for future comparative work. Part 2 discusses the challenges facing commissioners in relation to personalization, drawing on the reflections from practice. This will be of value to policy-makers, analysts, managers, and those involved in shaping frontline provision, setting out the benefits, hazards and dilemmas facing those charged with developing personalized public services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;It articulates the ambition of the Drug Strategy, which called for an increased focus on improving outcomes for individuals in treatment, with hard headed advice to ensure that local treatment needs are met, so service users recovere as soon as practicable and re-integrate back into society as well as demonstrating how treatment is the first step on the road to recovery. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>NICE commissioning guide</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This commissioning guide provides support for the local implementation of NICE clinical guidelines through commissioning, and is a resource to help health and social care professionals in England to commission an effective service for the treatment and management of schizophrenia in adults (18 years and over) with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia with onset before age 60. The schizophrenia guideline does not address the specific treatment of young people under the age of 18, except those who are receiving treatment and support from early intervention services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioning a comprehensive range of interventions, including services that promote recovery for people with schizophrenia, needs effective joint commissioning between primary care trusts (PCTs) and local authorities to ensure integrated partnership working across the NHS, social care, housing sector, not-for-profit and private sector organisations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This commissioning guide should be read together with the following NICE guidance:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG82/NiceGuidance/pdf/English" target="_blank"&gt;NICE clinical guideline CG82. Schizophrenia: core interventions in the treatment and management of schizophrenia in adults in primary and secondary care&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The clinical guideline covers clinical and cost effectiveness in detail and underpins the content of this guide. Implementation of the guidance noted above is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement this guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in the guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.nice.org.uk/usingguidance/commissioningguides/schizophrenia/commissioning.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;makes the case for commissioning a schizophrenia service&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.nice.org.uk/usingguidance/commissioningguides/schizophrenia/specifying.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;specifies service requirements&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.nice.org.uk/usingguidance/commissioningguides/schizophrenia/determining.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;helps you determine local service levels&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.nice.org.uk/usingguidance/commissioningguides/schizophrenia/ensuring.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;helps you ensure corporate and quality assurance.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This commissioning guide provides support for the local implementation of NICE clinical guidelines through commissioning, and is a resource to help healthcare professionals in England to commission, together with other relevant agencies, an effective service for the diagnosis and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults (ADHD). The guide covers the transition of young people with ADHD receiving treatment and care from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) or paediatric services to adult services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioning this service is likely to require healthcare commissioners to work closely with health and social services, education and employment services to provide a multidisciplinary response to adults and young people in transition with ADHD. In many areas there are currently no mechanisms in place for specialist tertiary mental health services to support general mental health teams in the provision of adult ADHD services. Therefore commissioners may wish to consider reviewing provision across a region, including how best to improve access to adult ADHD services and manage the transition for young people with ADHD.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This commissioning guide should be read in conjunction with the following NICE guidance:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG72/NiceGuidance/pdf/English" target="_blank"&gt;NICE clinical guideline CG72 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Diagnosis and management of ADHD in children, young people and adults&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Healthcare Commission and HMIP have published a joint report on the commissioning of healthcare services in prisons.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The watchdogs said commissioning of healthcare services by primary care trusts (PCTs) was variable and did not always meet the health needs of individual prisoners.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report points to lack of planning and poor assessment of the health needs of prisoners. This meant that PCTs were not always able to provide the right services or ensure the right number or mix of staff.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The watchdogs also said that many PCTs did not commission court diversion schemes, which may help to divert offenders with mental health problems out of the criminal justice system and into appropriate health services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This document looks at how commissioners can respond to the big challenges in the coming years. It says policy makers will need to ensure commissioners have the right tools to deliver the scale of change required. Payment by results and the current standard NHS and GP contracts will need to be reviewed to ensure they are designed to drive efficiency and productivity. It highlights a number of ways in which commissioners can improve quality in the NHS by driving efficiency and productivity through best practice, reducing the prices of services and volumes of activity, and looking at cheaper, high quality options available.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report represents an&amp;nbsp;analysis of the impact the previous processes for establishing commissioning priorities and monitoring progress against them has had on health outcomes and levels of expenditure. It:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Sets out the background to commissioning prioritisation and examines why it will be important in the new NHS world&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Analyses whether commissioning prioritisation leads to a faster rate of performance improvement&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Assesses the impact that commissioning prioritisation appears to have on health service expenditure&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Examines the extent to which commissioning prioritisation has been aligned with other elements of the system, including regulation and quality reporting&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Investigates the extent to which commissioning prioritisation has been subject to local democratic scrutiny&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Makes recommendations on how outcomes prioritisation should be implemented in the new world and how the system can be better aligned to support this&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report draws on Health Mandate’s Commissioning Intelligence Tracker (CommIT) and Provider Intelligence Tracker (ProvIT) databases, which enable analysis of the commissioning and provider priorities of every NHS organisation in England.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Camden Council has teamed up with the new economics foundation (nef) to develop outcome based procurement that will support sustainable communities, and demonstrate the added community value from third sector service provision.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Commissioning and procurement have been accused of ignoring service users, going for the cheapest option irrespective of quality, squeezing out small providers, and playing safe. To address this, Camden Council has teamed up with the new economics foundation (nef) to develop outcome based procurement that will support sustainable communities, and demonstrate the added community value from third sector service provision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Aims:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;develop and pilot a new outcome based commissioning model 
&lt;LI&gt;increase opportunities for third sector organisations to engage in the design and delivery of services in Camden 
&lt;LI&gt;develop third sector supply side through capacity building and support&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So far the project has:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;involved small local providers in market development and delivered a new consortium approach 
&lt;LI&gt;brought about innovative partnerships with service users and voluntary sector providers in ‘co-production’ in service design, bringing service users greater choice and control 
&lt;LI&gt;achieved strategic coherence between service level outcomes and wider social, economic and environmental sustainability 
&lt;LI&gt;endeavoured to quantify third sector ‘added value’ in the procurement environment developed and promoted tools for individuals to measure their own progress, and for commissioners to evaluate and compare service performance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Practical guide to commissioning pathways.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This practical guide aims to support commissioning managers by creating a structured approach to commissioning planned care pathways. It is not an exhaustive list of commissioning actions. It can help you with the following questions:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;I know which pathway I need to work on, but where do I start?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;We've made some progress, but what next?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Progress has become difficult, is there another route we could take?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;I need to communicate a potential route for the redesign of this pathway, waht is there to help me structure that?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;I need to write a structure for a pathway workshop tomorrow, where can I get some help quickly?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;SPAN class=409042009-18052006&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;This report sets out a unique approach to the commissioning of specialised paediatric services. It will be of particular interest to those involved in commissioning or delivering these services, but it has broader implications. It provides a clinically agreed system for representing the nature of the relationships between specialised services, and sets out which services need to be delivered from the same location and which do not. This will be of interest to those assessing the configuration of paediatric services and indeed any services that relate to them - both wider children's services and services to adults.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This guide note aims to support commissioners in their work through the provision of a checklist which will help them to assess their current practice and which may also act as a basis for local development and change.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guide note is the product of regional workshops in which the roles of commissioners, practitioners and clinicians were examined with a view to improving commissioning practice and better outcomes for end users. It aims to support commissioners in their work to secure effective services for people who live with the effects of long term neurological conditions. It is part of the work arising from the National Service&amp;nbsp;Framework (NSF) for long term neurological conditions, and reflects the commitments outlined in 'Our&amp;nbsp;health, our care, our say'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It provides a checklist which commissioners may use to help assess their current practice and as a basis for local development and change. It focuses on issues for commissioners that are particularly associated with services for people with long term neurological conditions. These issues are:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;leading the development of complex patterns of service; 
&lt;LI&gt;understanding the importance of commissioning partnerships between funders of services; 
&lt;LI&gt;understanding long term neurological conditions and their effects; 
&lt;LI&gt;finding sources of information about the need for services in a given population; 
&lt;LI&gt;designing performance measures which match commissioning intentions; 
&lt;LI&gt;challenging providers to match redesigned care pathways; 
&lt;LI&gt;understanding the connection between services commissioned locally; by PCTs, practice based commissioners, local authorities and jointly; and specialised services commissioned on a regional or national basis; 
&lt;LI&gt;understanding the impact of health service reforms on commissioning services; 
&lt;LI&gt;embedding commissioning continuing health care services into mainstream commissioning practices, in accordance with DH policy guidance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The role of commissioners in reducing drug-related deaths.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Over the last ten years, there has been increasing concern at the rising numbers of preventable drug related deaths. Many drug-related deaths can be prevented by commissioning and providing a baseline of quality services that are evidence-based and responsive to local need. The aim is to provide treatment through integrated care pathways across all four treatment tiers that are as seamless as possible, as indicated in Models of care (NTA 2002). The establishment of effective interfaces between services across all tiers of service provision requires communication and collaboration between services. Central to this are joint commissioning of services, common assessment /referral protocols that are appropriate to each tier and the establishment of robust service level agreements.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This guidance report contains advice, drawn on best practice from across the country, and provides direct help to commissioners that, if followed, should result in an improved quality of specialist learning disability health services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P align=left&gt;The commissioning of specialist health services for people with learning disabilities is an important function of Primary Care Trusts – in partnership with their local authority colleagues. A number of recent reports, most noticeably the Healthcare Commission reports into abuse in Cornwall and Merton and Sutton, have shown that these services are not always commissioned effectively and in line with best practice. In response to this, Ministers promised that the Department of Health would produce this good practice advice on commissioning these services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This advice draws on best practice from across the country and provides direct help to commissioners that, if followed, will result in an improved quality of specialist learning disability health services. It covers descriptions of: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The changing demand for and supply of services 
&lt;LI&gt;How these services fit into the wider changes in the NHS 
&lt;LI&gt;The policy context 
&lt;LI&gt;Detailed descriptions of the different component parts of specialist learning disability health services 
&lt;LI&gt;A resource guide for further information and support 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Whilst the Valuing People policy is, quite rightly, a policy based on promoting the rights of people with learning disabilities and their social inclusion, this can only be achieved if people have the right services and supports to meet the health needs that arise directly from their learning disability. Such services have not always, in the past, been delivered in a way that helps to promote social inclusion. This guidance is an important tool in helping to ensure that this is the case in the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This new report looks at the experiences of local authorities up and down the UK in developing new ways of commissioning public services, working with partners in the private and voluntary sectors to rethink how services could operate. Top-down prescriptions will increasingly need to be replaced by more efficient, productive and flexible approaches that reflect the specific demands of different areas and their populations. Many local authorities are making progress using a range of models to commission services - this report showcases among others innovative models for getting the long-term unemployed into work and giving adult social care clients more options for arranging the support they require.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This document describes an approach to priority setting that has been developed and tested to help commissioners make robust decisions with the support of their community. The approach detailed in this briefing has the benefit of being backed by an expert technical team with a rigorous 'value for money' analysis. It critically incorporates engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, and couples this with technical value for money analysis. This allows commissioners to take account of different factors when deciding which areas of healthcare to focus on and provides evidence to determine where resources can be most effectively invested.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This research aimed to gather robust evidence of providers’ views and experiences of being commissioned by local authorities and their Children’s Trusts partners in order to inform DCSF development of commissioning policy. It also sought to identify why providers enter or leave markets, expand or retrench services, their view of the future and to assess Compact compliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A total of 1,500 providers (public, private and third sector) of selected services for children, young people and families in England in 2009 completed a telephone survey. To be eligible, providers had to have bid for or received funding from local authorities, other Children’s Trust partners or from schools in 08-09.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Definition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;'Better joining up of services at the local level&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;'26&lt;/STRONG&gt;. At the moment too much primary care is commissioned&amp;nbsp;without integrating with the social care being commissioned by the local authority. There will be much more joint commissioning between PCTs and local authorities. We will develop a procurement model and best practice guidance to underpin a joint commissioning framework for health and well-being.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;'27&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To assist this, we will streamline budgets and planning cycles between PCTs and local authorities based on a shared, outcome-based performance framework. There will be aligned performance assessment and inspection regimes. Local Area Agreements should be a key mechanism for joint planning and&amp;nbsp;delivery. There will&amp;nbsp;be a strengthened role of Director of Adult Social Care, a wider role for Directors of Public Health, and more joint health and social care appointments. Work by a new National Reference Group for Health and Well-being will provide a sound evidence base for commissioning, including evidence from the Partnerships for Older People projects.' (1)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'&lt;STRONG&gt;Commissioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'3.13 A greater focus on joint commissioning between healthcare and social care and better integration between healthcare, social care and other local government services will bring benefits for patients and service users. We are looking to PCTs, working in partnership with practice based commissioners and local authorities, to ensure that commissioning makes an increasing contribution towards supporting the needs of patients and giving them more control over their care. Strong contracting arrangements will be key to driving these changes.' (2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'1.5 Our aspiration is for better health and increased well-being for everyone. This can only be achieved by local communities in every part of the country working together to tackle inequalities and promote equality. It also means working jointly to develop services that are more personal to individuals and provided closer to home; increasingly building on a closer integration of health, social care and other service providers, helping people to stay as healthy and as independent as possible.'

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;What is meant by 'community engagement'? This report looks at how we define communities and addresses barriers that some communities face when accessing health services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is a key focus on maternity, which seems to have specific obstacles around engagement.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The report contains a number of recommendations including:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Understand and define 'community engagement'. Being clear about the group you are working with and the aspects of engagement you wish to use is essential for success.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Make sure you have an authentic community: those who belong to it should identify with each other and recognise themselves as a community or group with shared activities and aspirations.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Find and work with leaders, or those with leadership potential, in that community.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This document describes the ways in which health needs assessment can identify priority health needs, target resources to address inequalities and involve local people.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Community health needs assessment has a central part to play in dealing with rising demand and limited resources. It&amp;nbsp;enables practitioners, managers and policy-makers to identify those in greatest need and to ensure that health care resources are used to maximize health improvement. It is a&amp;nbsp;vital health care planning tool to be used at the level of families, communities and populations. This document describes the ways in which health needs assessment can identify priority health needs, target resources to address inequalities and involve local people. The process of undertaking health needs is described and the important contribution of nurses explored. The document also includes a pack for training the trainers in the use of the assessment tool.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The purpose of the atlas is to present Compendium Indicators in a user-friendly graphical format combining maps, tables and charts in a way that allows the user to select, filter, sort and generally explore the data.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This is the public version of the atlas. The version accessible to NHS staff can be found here: &lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: blue; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;A href="https://mail.kingsfund.org.uk/OWA/redir.aspx?C=7d2e745f39214e3eb02b8420fe99edec&amp;amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fnww.nchod.nhs.uk%2f" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;http://nww.nchod.nhs.uk/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of the atlas is to present Compendium Indicators in a user-friendly graphical format combining maps, tables and charts in a way that allows the user to select, filter, sort and generally explore the data. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are three types of Atlas, each of which presents the data in a different way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Nested Rate Plot: Presents organisations’ data and confidence intervals nested within groups of similar organisations (using the ONS Area Classification Groups). &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Funnel Plot: Presents the distribution of organisations’ data compared to that expected. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Correlation Plot: Allows the user to map and compare the relationship between two indicators.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Separate versions of these atlases are required to present data for different organisation levels for example, Local Authority, and Primary Care Organisation.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

The purpose of this paper is to look at how the introduction of competition is going to work and what it will mean for all stakeholders and organisations involved.</description>

&lt;P&gt;The Consortium's structure and the rules or procedures governing the operation of the Consortium are entirely a matter for local agreement. However, it is essential that the members of each Consortium write a constitution, which explains the structure of the Consortium and sets out the necessary rules and procedures constituting the operating framework of the Consortium. The aim of these Guidance Notes is to put forward a list of subject headings on the basis that a constitution should, where appropriate, include detailed rules dealing with the operation of the Consortium in the areas covered by those subject headings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;The framework for commissioning specialised services has recently changed as a result of a comprehensive review. This guide aims to clarify the new framework and help Members of Overview and Scrutiny Committees and staff within Specialised Commissioning Groups to develop effective relationships aimed at ensuring quality and equity for patients using specialised services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this guide is to provide practical advice to health overview and scrutiny committees (OSCs) and commissioners of specialised services about how OSCs can best be engaged in and consulted on arrangements for commissioning and providing specialised services. The guide may also help OSCs to identify how they might tackle proposals for substantial variations to other services that are commissioned on a collective basis by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;sets out the context of specialised services commissioning and delivery, and identifies who is responsible for making decisions about changes to them 
&lt;LI&gt;describes who is responsible for patient and public involvement and engagement and consultation with OSCs with regard to specialised services 
&lt;LI&gt;presents practical advice and examples of good practice to help OSCs and commissioners understand how to develop effective arrangements for engagement and consultation concerning proposed substantial variations to specialised services 
&lt;LI&gt;provides a checklist that can be used as a planning tool in preparing for engagement of OSCs around collectively commissioned services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Consulting the public is an important component of commissioning health services. This article gives an account of a method of consultation devised by Somerset Health Authority using eight focus groups meeting three times a year. Each group consists of 12 people, and together the groups are demographically representative of Somerset's population. The groups are asked about issues that are concerning the health authority, and their views have influenced health authority decisions. Each group is given some background information before the meeting, together with more information at the meeting. The discussions are tape recorded and analysed for qualitative information, but the groups are also asked to score certain priorities. The groups have been found to be representative, valid, and focused on community rather than individual values. The authors recommend that health authorities wanting to know the values people attach to health services should adopt this qualitative approach to consultation.]]&gt;</body>

(1)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'1.2 The NHS Contract for Acute Hospital Services, (the Standard Contract), will cover agreements between primary care trusts (PCTs) and providers of acute hospital-based care (Providers).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[...]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'1.5 The Standard Contract will create legally binding agreements between PCTs and FTs, and between PCTs and independent and third sector providers. Agreements between PCTs and NHS Trusts will be in exactly the same form and be treated with the same degree of rigour and seriousness as if they were legally binding.' (2)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'Commissioners can incentivise the promotion of health, well-being, dignity and independence for all. They can do this by:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[...]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'using contracts and putting in place a contractual regime (including national contract templates) that encourages providers to incorporate a health and well-being element in all that they do, to deliver health, well-being and independence. Local commissioners should use contracts to improve the health and well-being of the wider population, especially those who are directly employed by partners and commissioned providers. For example, commissioners may choose to award preferred status, or pay a premium to providers that deliver continuous quality improvement as shown by improving outcomes for service users and that contribute to reducing social exclusion. This might be, for example by taking part in 'back to work' schemes that help people with mental health problems enter paid employment. Contracts can also be used to improve access, ensure that equality legislation is implemented and promote the well-being of employees. The Department is developing a national contract template for out-of-hospital services to give practical effect to this type of approach. (3)&lt;BR&gt;

    <description>This paper is the first in a short series of three that draw on the experience of providing evidence to the Health Select Committee's 2008 inquiry into health inequalities.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Questions asked by managers, commissioners and policy makers to find out what is, or should be, happening within health visiting services can seem immensely helpful in focusing the mind or clarifying key points. Alternatively, they may feel hostile and accusative, if their starting assumptions are alien to the everyday experience of health visitors. This paper is the first in a short series of three that draw on the experience of providing evidence to the Health Select Committee's 2008 inquiry into health inequalities. A formal process of seeking written evidence was followed up with specific questions in oral session, asked by committee members, trying to find out about how health visiting services relate to health inequalities. This line of questioning reflects concerns expressed elsewhere about the variability of health visiting services across the country and the lack of clear alignment to areas of deprivation, leading to calls for an increase in targeted services, instead of universal ones. This paper explores the notion of 'caseload', the distribution of services according to levels of deprivation and delivery of a universal or targeted health visiting service.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Although the health and social care white paper&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4127453?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;amp;dID=456&amp;amp;Rendition=Web" target="_blank"&gt;Our&amp;nbsp;health, our care, our say &lt;/A&gt;sets a clear strategic direction for community health and social services, PCT reorganisation and NHS financial difficulties have inevitably focused health care management attention on internal NHS issues. In academic circles, a number of researchers are increasingly wondering if the evidence really exists to support the assumption that partnerships lead to better outcomes for service users.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This discussion paper explores three key elements of a potential new relationship between PCTs and local government:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The importance of health (services) to people's sense of place. 
&lt;LI&gt;The need for PCTs to find better ways of assuring legitimacy and public engagement, especially in relation to how they manage scarcity and prioritise resources. 
&lt;LI&gt;The available models of how the relationship between PCTs and local government could be different and beneficial to both organisations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

This report examines place of death for people for whom Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and senility were recorded on the death certificate.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The analyses, which examine numbers, age and gender profiles, and place of death, use mortality data compiled by the ONS, based on death registrations for which Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and senility were recorded either as the ‘underlying’ cause of death or as a ‘contributory’ cause. The analyses are based on deaths in people who were usually resident in England and who died between 2001 and 2009.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"The term demand management refers to actions taken by primary care trusts and/or GP practices to moderate the demand for health care services. Hospital demand management refers to actions taken to moderate the rate of referrals of patients to hospitals. A referral management centre assesses the clinical appropriateness of GP referrals before treatment is allowed to proceed."

This will require improvements in the operational management of outpatient capacity and demand." (4)&lt;/P&gt;

This is the core business of all NHS organisations. The four areas of focus remain heart disease, cancer, childresn and maternity, but the aim is to reduce demand for acute services across the board and reduce health inequalities...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;...'Proposals must deliver improved quality and patient experience, as well as increased productivity; must be affordable (reducing management costs and transaction costs); and must help to manage the demand for services more effectively (eg reducing acute admissions and lengths of stay).

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Third Sector is an important partner in shaping the future of Plymouth's Children's Trust and key to ensuring improved commissioning and market development. Commissioners in the statutory sector have worked with the Third Sector to develop a more inclusive approach which recognises its strengths and begins to remove barriers. Work over the last two years has included:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a series of consultations and events focused on commissioning for innovation and the role of the Third Sector in all stages of the commissioning process 
&lt;LI&gt;providing training with and to voluntary and community organisations in specific areas, in order to develop the market 
&lt;LI&gt;modernisation of the procurement process. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a result, Plymouth is beginning to derive benefits from this increased partnership working, which include:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;increased participation in recent tendering exercises by the Third Sector 
&lt;LI&gt;voluntary-sector and community-sector providers report that the process has promoted increased participation and an open dialogue with the LA as purchaser 
&lt;LI&gt;increased added value through contracts let. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This resource is aimed at commissioners and GP Consortia to give guidance for putting a compact together in the most effective and efficient way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The move to develop GP consortia as the organisations responsible for commissioning is set to challenge individuals across the entire system. Commissioning is a complex activity and to be successful a partnership approach will be required. Alongside taking on this complex activity, GP consortia will need to establish and develop rapidly as coherent organisations. This guide has been prepared to help clinical commissioners answer three questions:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;What is a compact? 
&lt;LI&gt;How can you use a compact as a means to develop your consortium? 
&lt;LI&gt;How do we go about developing a compact?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

It is clear that a number of useful performance indicators, including, for example, QOF, access surveys, patient surveys and premises surveys now exist to support this function. Nowhere however, are these different performance indicators brought together to allow a more balanced assessment of primary care performance and development. The purpose of this paper is therefore to bring these indicators together, set out minimum acceptable standards, and the PCT’s approach to improving standards.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ From chapter 8 of commissioning e-book. Ealing had problems with aspects of its services for older people - increasingly obsolete buildings; high unit costs and poor economies of scale; competition for scarce independent sector residential and nursing care; escalating fees; a lack of co-ordination of day care and being unable to meet rising aspirations. An option appraisal led to plans to build three resource centres and a nursing home through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI). The Department of Health and Treasury awarded significant PFI credits and procurement began. This case study describes the process and lessons learned in delivering a successful and ground-breaking social care PFI.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance and individual supporting guides explain why Pharmaceutical Needs Assessments (PNAs) are important and how they fit into PCTs’ planning cycles. It sets out a recommended methodology on producing a new PNA or revising an existing one. The guidance is structured around five steps:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Getting the engagement right&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identifying local needs&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Mapping current provision&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Shaping the future&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Action planning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you are starting a new PNA the steps can be followed sequentially. If you are updating an old PNA or drawing from a range of existing documents, you can choose which individual guides are most useful to you. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The link provided here goes to the full report which includes all 21 PNA guides, however if you wish to download them separately please visit &lt;A href="http://www.nhsemployers.org/PayAndContracts/CommunityPharmacyContract/Pages/PNA_Guidance.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;this page&lt;/A&gt; on the NHS Employers website. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;NHS London reviewed the money that it spends on education and training of its&amp;nbsp; healthcare workforce, with the goal of proposing a new education commissioning system. This followed the the consolidation of 5 previous SHAs into one, driving the need for a standardised education commissioning s ystem that was fit for the needs of London.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of the project was to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;examine the funding flows, roles and responsibilities across the three major funding streams within the MPET budget&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;identify major issues in education commissioning&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;propose an idealised process and governing principles for education commissioning in London&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This document lays out the findings of the diagnostic process, the proposed commissioning process for NMET, SIFT and MADEL, and lists and prioritises the actions that the SHA needs to take in implementing a workable system.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Reflects an idealised model that can be used to plan, develop, review and/or commission services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This draft set of standards has arisen from a series of 18 regional workshops, sponsored by the Department of Health, on re-configuring day opportunities. These standards reflect what was reported as current good practice around the country and an idealised model of day opportunities that can be used to plan, develop, review and/or commission services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The standards have been drafted to meet the needs of all adult client groups and will, when finalised, be accompanied by an audit tool and developmental workbook. &lt;FONT face=Arial size=3&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;These standards recognise the change of emphasis for day services/opportunities in that they should not automatically be viewed as a service for life, but as a stepping stone to independence. It is therefore vitally important that day services are clear as to what they offer, who is eligible and appropriate, and what outcomes can be achieved. All measurements in this document are from a user’s perspective which should be regularly sought and independently validated as part of the overall monitoring of the day service. The next stage is a national consultation on these draft standards, following which the final version will be published. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=3&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Unison is calling on the Government to ‘think again’ about its NHS outsourcing and privatisation agenda, in the light of this new report.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ According to Unison, the government needs to rethink its approach to NHS reforms in the wake of a report on the cost of commissioning and outsourcing. The report by the Office for Public Management, but commissioned by Unison, says outsourcing in the NHS has failed to deliver value for money, patient involvement or improved working conditions.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report summarising the work of six learning sets established as phase two of the Renal Action Learning Set programme.  It captures both the practical outputs and the spirit of the work of each set.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The National Service Framework for Renal Services (Renal NSF) set out the challenge to provide patient centred, high quality services in every aspect of renal care. Many of the issues raised within the NSF are complex, involving multi-organisations and professional groups and, in some cases, these have proved difficult to resolve fully. There are a wealth of national guidelines and policies but, despite this, sustainable service improvement has not happened everywhere. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report summarises the work of six learning sets established as phase two of the Renal Action Learning Set programme. It aims to capture not only the practical outputs from each set, but also the spirit of their work in order to encourage others to tackle the service difficulties they face in their own areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

Drawing on evidence from those primary care trusts (PCTs) which are furthest ahead, it identifies the key areas that PCTs and practices should be focusing on in the early stages of implementation and sets the scene for a fuller national report on practice based commissioning, to be published in early 2007. &lt;/SPAN&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This document summarises the key issues around considering, planning and creating a partnering relationship with an IT service provider. Its focus is not on formal procurement, contracts or service delivery management. Instead, it covers the critical factors in creating a strong working relationship built on mutual benefit - taking the right approach, creating the right behaviours, putting the right people in place and managing the arrangement in the right way in order to achieve a successful outcome for both parties.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guidance is primarily intended for those leading the project and programme teams in the customer and provider organisations. It will also be of interest to everyone who may be involved in a partnering arrangement. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance, published in March 2006, produced by the NHS Alliance, the National Association for Patient Participation and Developing Patient Partnerships, presents research into the views of the public, health professionals and primary care trusts about the issue of patient involvement. It outlines the benefits of patient and public involvement (PPI) for practice based commissioning (PBC), puts PPI in context and offers guidance on what issues to consult on for effective PBC. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To develop a view of current attitudes towards PPI, three surveys were carried out by Developing Patient Partnerships and the NHS Alliance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;health professionals' attitudes to PPI&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the public's attitudes to PPI&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;PCTs' approaches to PPI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The results of the surveys of health professionals and the public demonstrate that, although there is an increasing amount of involvement and a positive approach by professionals, the actual experience of patients seems to be poor, highlighting a general lack of awareness of PPI and a pessimistic view of how they can have an influence. The survey of PCTs suggests that some practices are experiencing barriers to involving patients in the early phases of practice based commissioning, even though there may be adequate mechanisms to facilitate this.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Summary:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What do commissioners need next?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Recognition for improvements already delivered.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Workforce development that recognises the skills needed to commission services for long term conditions - far more broad ranging than for episodic elective care.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Policy frameworks that support effective commissioning for long term conditions - or avoid disincentives or perverse incentives.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Career pathways that can bring together skills acquired in commissioning and provider organisations.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Reassurance that long term conditions will remain high on the agenda.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guide and the accompanying six quality markers aims to support London’s service providers and commissioners improve end of life care in the capital.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It advises London-based commissioners and clinicians on how to implement a model of care which provides for at least 50 per cent of deaths outside hospital by March 2013 and to improve the experience of all patients who die whilst being cared for by health and social care services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide proposes a number of quality markers and standards which PCTs are encouraged to incorporate into their commissioning plans, together with effective mechanisms for monitoring the processes and outcomes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report looks at community engagement projects and provides some ideas about what can make them work well. A community engagement project involves talking to people in different communities about what they want and need from their healthcare services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This kind of project can help healthcare professionals to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;determine local needs and aspirations 
&lt;LI&gt;promote health and reduce health inequalities 
&lt;LI&gt;improve service design and quality of care 
&lt;LI&gt;strengthen local accountability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The report stresses that, in order for a community engagement project to be effective, it is important to consider the community it is aimed at by:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;finding out exactly how people want to get involved 
&lt;LI&gt;providing as much support as possible for people to get involved in the project easily 
&lt;LI&gt;making sure community members know that their views will be taken into account when any decisions about healthcare are made once the project is complete.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ To ensure that lessons learned from the LINks Early Adopter projects will inform future policy-making (particularly for the new health and social care regulator, the Care Quality Commission) the Healthcare Commission asked the National Consumer Council (NCC) to provide an independent consumer advocacy perspective. With its insight into citizens’ needs and good practice in citizen engagement, NCC’s role was to act as a ‘critical friend’. Using participatory observation as its principal research method, the NCC shadowed the Healthcare Commission’s work on its two EAP sites from February to September 2007. In particular, NCC undertook fieldwork at a range of events organised by the Healthcare Commission with patients and the public (including ‘seldom-heard’ groups) and interviewed a range of individuals, including Healthcare Commission staff and other stakeholders, at national and local levels.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The NCC concludes that regulators are going to be central to the success of user-centred public service reform. In preparation for the new LINks, the Healthcare Commission has developed some innovative ways in which regulation can make use of the experiences and knowledge of the public; the proposals laid out in this document are potentially relevant not only to the Care Quality Commission, but to a range of public service regulators. A new regulatory framework will need to encourage local service providers to put the public back into public services. A major rethink of commissioning will need to consider how commissioning can influence service design, and how the user perspective can inform the process; minimum standards for user and public involvement will drive the message home. The LINks are an opportunity to progress user-focused public service reform, and the way they are set up and operate locally will help to determine their success.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;This report was published in January 2008.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>New guide aimed at helping trusts maximise the benefits of the patient feedback facility on NHS Choices.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;One of the key features of NHS Choices is the patient feedback facility. From launch in June 2007, the public has been able to write and post feedback on their hospital experience and to date, over 7,000 comments have been posted.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Patients are asked to provide feedback on what they liked and suggestions they may have for how things could be improved. The volume of patient feedback has risen significantly since the facility appeared on the home page of NHS Choices. NHS Choices’ site traffic currently stands at 4 million visitors per month, and with all of NHS Direct’s online health content now on NHS Choices, this figure is expected to rise rapidly. It is expected therefore, that the level of patient feedback will continue to rise too.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide details how Hospital Trusts can get the most out of the patient feedback facility on NHS Choices. There are three main reasons why publishing patient feedback on NHS Choices is a positive development for Hospital Trusts:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;feedback from previous patients is a useful source of information for others who may be in the process of making a decision on their choice of provider&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the vast majority of patients are very satisfied with the care they receive&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;a constant source of responsibly moderated patient feedback is very helpful for Trusts as a driver of service improvement and provides public recognition of the high quality of care delivered&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

The study combined an analysis of national data with visits to a representative sample of mental health trusts. It covered four themes: age discrimination in mental health services; quality of inpatient care; how comprehensive services are; and how organisations work together to provide services. There are 14 recommendations for the Government, the Care Quality Commission, NHS trusts and service providers, to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to improve mental health services for older people.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The baseline survey was sent to a wide range of third sector organisations (TSOs) but findings could not be analysed by ethnicity.&amp;nbsp;Discussion of initial baseline findings with stakeholders showed that this was likely to be important, so additional research was organised with TSOs working with Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities in order to supplement the baseline. In a focus group, BME TSOs' current experiences of commissioning and whether any additional barriers or difficulties exist around their involvement in commissioning was explored.&amp;nbsp;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The contemporary policy environment makes persistent demands on agency officials to use the best information available when making decisions about policies, programs, and practices. State and federal legislation calls on agencies to incorporate evidence-based practices in their programs. Using data from a 2008 survey of state agency administrators, this report examines the extent to which state government agencies draw upon various sources of information to guide their decisions about programmatic operations. The findings reveal the extent to which agencies rely on, or weight, scientific studies and formal evaluations compared to other sources. The paper offers new insights into the use of information, particularly scientific evidence, in state agency decision-making, offering the first systematic look at how widely such information is used.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Treatments and services are rarely purchased based on scientific evidence. Purchasing is typically based on individual opinion and judgement, or led by the marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers. Commissioning without systematically consulting evidence is a cause of the wide variance in practice, outcomes and spend we see across health systems. How can you be sure you're not contributing to this situation? How can you be sure you are buying what is truly best for your patients and not just wasting money? The following checklist will help.

&lt;P&gt;'3.4 The NHS has started to deploy...the surplus built up in PCTs and SHAs that was brought forward to 2009/10...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'3.5 However, notwithstanding the growth in funding for health in 2010/11, with the challenge for public finances ahead, settlements in the medium term will be tighter. Consequently the emphasis of the NHS financial strategy going forward should be to ensure that PCTs and SHAs have flexibility in their spending plans that provide the capability to manage risk and volatility.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'3.6 The SHA and PCT sector will plan to end 2010/11 with an aggregate surplus of £1 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 1 per cent of NHS allocations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'3.7 SHAs must ensure that PCTs do not recurrently commit the totality of their recurred funding in their 2010/11 polans, such that at least 2 per cent of recurrent funding at the aggregate regional level is only ever committed non-recurrently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'3.8 In support of medium-term financial planning, the NHS should expect that the surplus produced by the PCT/SHA sector at the end of 2010/11 will be carried forward for full deployment during the next Spending Review period, indicatively 2011/12 to 2013/14, at a rate determined by SHAs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'3.11 The Department continues to expect that no NHS organisation will plan for an operating deficit in 2010/11 unless this is part of a planned recovery path agreed with the relevant SHA and the Department.

For example, where a level one organisation might have incomplete and inadequate financial management practices in place, a level five organisation could be expected to have leading edge financial management practices in place. Not all organisations should necessarily aim for level five – it will be a matter for each organisation’s judgement which level is appropriate for its business needs and whether the cost of transformation is proportionate.</description>

    <description>This document is for policy makers, procurers and end users within the public sector who want to seek and, where appropriate, procure innovative solutions to help meet their needs more effectively.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The identification and procurement of innovative solutions to public service needs is one potential way of delivering improvements in the quality and delivery of services, as well as assisting the public sector achieve better long-term value for money. It can also stimulate innovation within the economy by enabling the market to respond to current and future public service needs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This document is for policy makers, procurers and end users within the public sector who want to seek and, where appropriate, procure innovative solutions to help meet their needs more effectively. The principles contained here are applicable to public procurers working at all levels of government.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The document demonstrates a number of approaches that can be followed to facilitate a call for innovative solutions and, where appropriate, that procurement of innovation can take place within the framework that governs public sector procurement. This framework comprises the European Union (EU) Procurement Directives, the EU Treaty principles of non-discrimination, equal-treatment and transparency, and the Government's procurement policy based on value for money. Compatibility must be considered from the outset of any search for innovative solutions, as there may be a risk that suppliers could be afforded undue preference should a procurement exercise follow later on. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;This report aims to shift the focus from simply reporting on data quality and coverage to providing information about service delivery and the impact on patients. It is the first national report to use data from the MHMDS and covers the years 2003/4 to 2006/7.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>FLoSC (Forecasting Length of Stay and Cost) assists local councils to analyse the patterns of length of stay (LOS) for publicly funded residents in institutional long-term care (LTC); and forecast cost of a council’s existing, known commitments for a period of time.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;FLoSC (Forecasting Length of Stay and Cost) assists local councils to analyse the patterns of length of stay (LOS) for publicly funded residents in institutional long-term care (LTC); and forecast cost of a council’s existing, known commitments for a period of time. The term known commitments refers to the group of publicly funded residents currently in residential care and nursing care.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Knowing the projected cost associated with known commitments is of particular interest to local councils as it corresponds to the burden that they cannot escape. This information will enable local councils to identify the fraction of their budget that is already committed due to past admission decisions. Given this information, local councils will have a fair idea about the resources available for new admissions in a financial year. FLoSC can also be used to compare forecasts under different cost scenarios, which may reflect possible future changes in pricing or costing policy. These functionalities are of crucial importance to the planning of a successful budget for LTC at local authority level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;FLoSC extracts high level patterns of residents' LOS and movements in institutional LTC based on data routinely captured by local councils, such as date of admission, date of discharge, destination of discharge, etc. Further, average weekly cost for each type of care, namely residential care (RC) and nursing care (NC), is incorporated to give a forecast of the cost arising from looking after the known commitments. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Top tips on tackling the bigger picture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;PBC needs to tackle change on a large scale if it is to deliver real reform. Emma Wilkinson asks the experts for their top tips 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Developing an escalator to reach new PBC heights&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Dr Stephen Shortt explains how a new ‘escalator’ model will ensure a give-and-take relationship between the PCT and commissioners 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How a sub-group model has created real change&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dr David Shovlin explains how PBC has tapped into the potential of existing small clinical sub-groups to drive commissioning strategies forward 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A federation to tackle the hard times&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Jenny Poole and Caroline Kerby explain how setting up a federation will put PBC at the heart of the PCT decision-making &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;What’s agreed – and what’s not?&lt;BR&gt;With major changes ahead for clinical commissioning, Alisdair Stirling sets out the common ground between the coalition partners and highlights the potential battlegrounds&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;My three commissioning wishes&lt;BR&gt;What does the new Government need to deliver on commissioning? Alisdair Stirling asked PBC experts for their three wishes&lt;/LI&gt;

    <title>Foundation trust accounts: a guide for non-executives and governors</title>

    <description>This guide focuses on the four primary statements and notes to the accounts, which make up part of Foundation Trust accounts, as specified by the NHS Foundation Trust Financial Reporting Manual.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;NHS organisations have a statutory duty to produce annual accounts, also known as financial statements. There is a requirement for the board of governors to review the annual accounts at a general meeting. The board of governors is also required to formally adopt the accounts once they have been audited and therefore it is vital that both Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and governors understand them. Alongside this formal requirement, understanding the annual accounts is imperative if NEDs and governors are to fully appreciate the financial health of their organisation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Foundation Trusts have some discretion over the exact formal and content of their annual accounts; however this discretion needs to be exercised within the accounting requirements of the NHS Foundation Trust Financial Reporting Manual.&amp;nbsp; This specifies the format of the accounts as:&amp;nbsp;foreword; four primary statements (Income and Expenditure account; Balance Sheet; Cash Flow Statement; Statement of&amp;nbsp;Total Recognised Gains and Losses); notes to the accounts; statement on internal control; directors' statement of responsibilities; and the auditor's report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide focuses on the four primary statements and the notes to the accounts. Each primary statement and the key notes to the accounts are explained. The guide also includes some questions and the key financial ratios that governors and NEDs should consider when reviewing and approving the annual accounts.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

These are important elements of the NHS reform programme, which puts patients at the heart of driving change in the NHS – directly through choice, and indirectly through influencing and shaping commissioning. Managing choice and competition is part of the broader functions of system management, which is the series of values, relationships, contracts and rules which are designed to protect and promote patients' and taxpayers’ interests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;FESC is designed to complement existing frameworks used by the NHS to procure services.&amp;nbsp; The majority of these will provide consultancy charged on a day-rate basis.&amp;nbsp; FESC, on the other hand, provides the opportunity for PCTs to partner with independent providers who can undertake aspects of the commissioning function with the PCT - whilst remaining accountable to the PCT board throughout.&amp;nbsp; Contractual arrangements are more robust and payment models are designed to incentivise suppliers to deliver the required value.&amp;nbsp; As a result, knowledge and skills are transferred to NHS staff and the PCT gets greater value for money.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The PCT has spent the past two years working alongside local clinicians to establish five area-based "polysystems" – GP-led networks of care professionals – that will be increasingly be responsible for the health needs of their respective communities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The polysystems differ in that GPs now have real financial and decision-making power to effect changes, such as the redesign of care pathways as well as commissioning services on both a local and borough-wide level via a clinical commissioning board.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This briefing sets out how general practice is organised, contracted and financed; analyses the impact of recent government policy; and looks at future trends.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;General practice has changed considerably over the past decade. Practice size has increased, the workforce has grown and become more diverse, the range of services offered has expanded, and the contracting and financing arrangements for GPs have changed. Current government policy aims to improve access and choice for patients, to enable greater self-management by people with long-term conditions, to expand the role of GPs in areas such as health promotion, to reduce variations in the quality of care provided and to improve quality overall. In the next few years, accreditation will be introduced for GP practices, and new models for commissioning and delivering care will be expanded.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=left&gt;This good practice guide provides primary care trusts (PCTs) with a number of key recommendations to help support clinics to reach the Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) 48-hour access target by March 2008, reduce the gap between offered and seen and maintain that level of access. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;These measures build on the &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Italic&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.library.nhs.uk/commissioning/ViewResource.aspx?resID=286861&amp;amp;tabID=288&amp;amp;catID=13417" target="_blank"&gt;10 High Impact Changes for Genitourinary Medicine 48-hour Access&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;(HIC)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman size=1&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;published by the Department of Health in December 2006. It should be used in conjunction with the HIC where PCT commissioners and their providers have considered and implemented, as appropriate, changes but are still looking to improve services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;In reviewing 48-hour access action plans, consideration should be given to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;the improved use of resources to enable&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;clinics to be run in the evenings, early mornings and at weekends; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;ensuring choice of access by offering a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;choice of both walk-in and appointment;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;promoting ‘informed choice’ to balance the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;public health risks of delayed attendance with patient choice, by encouraging patients to attend at the appropriate time for their particular concern;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;making use of outreach facilities to reduce&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;the travelling time or barriers to attending which are experienced in specific communities; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;the appropriate delivery of a service across&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;a sexual health network, bearing in mind the importance of ensuring that the needs of all sectors of the community are met.&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report outlining suggestions for new ways of working within cancer services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;FONT face=AGaramond-Regular&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Around a quarter of a million people are diagnosed with cancer in England each year. All are anxious and face uncertainty. Many require several different tests to diagnose their cancer accurately and then a combination of different treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Rapid access to high quality services and good coordination between different parts of the NHS can save lives and improve patients’ quality of life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This report looks at actual and possible improvements in cancer services from the perspective of the clinician.&amp;nbsp; It describes and considers: specialist teams; cancer networks; the centralisation of complex services and the possibility of more specialisation; moving services closer to patients; adapting staff roles to provider greater flexibility; and using hospital beds better and more efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This pamphlet argues that the route to public sector efficiency is to focus on effectiveness. Effective services are personalised--driven by people's needs, they take aim at the cause of problems rather than the consequences, and they are delivered collaboratively. Services driven by these principles result in better outcomes for citizens, a better quality of service, and happier staff. They also save money because getting things right the first time always works out cheaper.</description>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The report examines the team's Care Closer to Home programme, which worked with 14 projects on five sites around the country, shifting Care Outside Hospital. Examples of the projects include work in areas such as diabetes, end of life care and COPD. The projects worked in a number of environments, including working across a whole health community, working with the third sector, and integrating health and social care. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report summarises the findings from the projects about the key factors affecting the ability to bring about shifts in care. Based on these findings, it sets out the conditions that have to be met to enable shifts in care programmes of this kind to occur &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document / tools include: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The conditions that have to be met to enable shifts in care programmes to occur &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Situations it works well in:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;As preparation for change programmes involving shifting care/delivering care closer to home &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Priorities addressed: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The White Paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services outlines the Government's vision for community based care - this document gives detail of key factors that need to be in place to realise this priority.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Target audience:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;PCT Change programme teams looking to shift care to community settings&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

This paper analyzes the estimated cost of adopting a package of twenty proven preventive services—including tobacco cessation screening, alcohol abuse screening, and daily aspirin use—against the estimated savings that could be generated. It finds that greater use of proven clinical preventive services in the United States could avert the loss of more than two million lifeyears annually. It also finds that increasing the use of these services from current levels to 90 percent in 2006 would result in total savings of $3.7 billion, or 0.2 percent of U.S. personal health care spending. These findings suggest that policy makers should pursue options that move the nation toward greater use of proven preventive services.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Guidance on commissioning arrangements for specialised services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance amplifies advice given in Shifting the Balance of Power: the next steps, issued in January 2002, which emphasises Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are the primary commissioners of health care services for their local populations and expects them to act collaboratively when commissioning specialised services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In particular this guidance gives advice regarding the continuing role of Regional Specialised Commissioning Groups (RSCGs) or equivalent, and provides examples of good practice in collaborative commissioning of specialised services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guidance does not advise on commissioning arrangements for very highly specialised services; these services continue to be commissioned centrally by the Department of Health under the auspices of the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The new standard NHS contract for acute services, introduced in April 2008, includes a requirement in schedule 5 to report from April 2009 on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The Standard Contract is a standard, not a model contract.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It will create legally binding agreements between Primary Care Trusts and Foundation Trusts, and between Primary Care Trusts and independent and third sector providers.&amp;nbsp; Agreements between Primary Care Trusts and NHS Trusts will be in exactly the same form and be treated with the same degree of rigour and seriousness as if they were legally binding.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Guidelines on reducing the risk of adverse consequences arising from over-dependency.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ In December 2003, OGC published the report, 'Increasing competition and improving long term capacity planning in the Government marketplace'. This note fulfils one of the report's recommendations, to provide guidelines on the factors to be taken into account when seeking to reduce the risk of adverse consequences arising from over-dependency. It is not the intention of this note to discourage the establishment of long-term relationships or the benefits that such associations can bring, its purpose is to identify situations in which over-dependency is at risk of occurring, and then to establish the ways of avoiding and addressing any related issues that may arise.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act (2001), makes it a legal requirement for NHS trusts to involve patients in the ongoing development of services. It also identifies the need to consult when a substantial variation in service delivery is proposed. Because of the PCT's additional role in commissioning it is obliged to involve patients in that process also.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Camden Community and User Involvement in Health Network (CCUIHN) was formed to enable organisations in Camden to share good practice on issues relating to user and community involvement in health. CCUIHN members identified the need to develop "Good Practice Guidelines on Consultation" as one of their priority areas of work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guidelines aim to improve the quality of consultations and continue to strengthen partnerships working between the statutory organisations and with the voluntary and community sectors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guidelines have been based on Camden Council's Guidelines for Consultation (1998, 2003 and 2004). Additional appendices have also been developed.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;having fewer commissioning agencies and major provider units 
&lt;LI&gt;treating minor conditions in less specialized facilities or in general practice

&lt;P&gt;This chapter focuses on alcohol misuse, defined as the use of alcohol such as to damage or threaten to damage the health or social adjustment of the user, or those people directly affected by his or her drinking. The main arguments presented are that:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;services should be planned with a maximum of integration between different agencies, and between different levels of care, preferably with a community alcohol team or substance misuse integration team playing a key integrative and facilitatory role 
&lt;LI&gt;service improvement should seek to improve the use, and training, of staff in existing service settings rather than invent new ad hoc arrangements 
&lt;LI&gt;primary care and generalist care should be the main settings for treatment, with specialist care skill necessary on occasions, but deployed selectively.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;How do men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or the complications of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) present and what is the prevalence of the problem? 
&lt;LI&gt;How should men be assessed and managed? What is the role of the general practitioner and what magnitude of service should be provided? 
&lt;LI&gt;What is the role of drug treatment? 
&lt;LI&gt;What is the role of conventional surgical treatment (prostatectomy) compared with new technology? 
&lt;LI&gt;What are the areas of future research needs?

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;To support Primary Care Trusts and local authorities, the Association of Public Health Observatories and Department of Health have developed the Health Inequalities Intervention Tools. These tools are designed to support evidence-based local service planning and commissioning, including Joint Strategic Needs Assessments. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tools show the causes of death which are driving local health inequalities, with breakdowns by gender and age. They also show the impact evidence-based interventions can have on local health inequality gaps.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are currently two tools, one for Spearhead areas only and one for all areas. To assist Spearhead Primary Care Trusts and local authorities in planning to meet the life expectancy element of the national target, the Spearhead area tool addresses the life expectancy gap between a whole Spearhead area and the England average. The tool for all areas provides all English local authorities, and the PCTs that map to them, with information on within, as well as between, area inequalities. The tools can also be used to support planning to meet local targets set within Local Area Agreements, or as national priorities within the 2007 Operating Framework, particularly the Vital Signs and LAA National Indicator Set indicator for reducing All Age All Cause Mortality.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The HPI tool allows groups, differentiated by geography and cultural identity, to be contrasted in terms of their 'health poverty’. A group's 'health poverty' is a combination of both its present state of health and its future health potential or lack of it. The key justification for the selection of a particular set of groups is the expectation of an equal distribution of health and its determinants between the groups from the perspective of social justice.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Epidemiologically Based Needs Assessment Series was a project funded by the Department of Health and latterly the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) between 1991 and 2000.

This website gives details of the project and provides access to the 38 Needs Assessments covering a plethora of disease areas and populations.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a concise description of cancer of the lung, its causes and the options for prevention, treatment and care, so that commissioners may develop quantified cost-effective strategies in collaboration with the providers of the various services involved.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Epidemiologically Based Needs Assessment Series was a project funded by the Department of Health and latterly the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) between 1991 and 2000.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This website gives details of the project and provides access to the 38 Needs Assessments covering a plethora of disease areas and populations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this chapter is to provide a concise description of cancer of the lung, its causes and the options for prevention, treatment and care, so that commissioners may develop quantified cost-effective strategies in collaboration with the providers of the various services involved. Detailed recommendations on commissioning have been drawn up by the Cancer Guidance Group of the Clinical Outcomes Group funded by the NHS Executive in England and this chapter is based largely on that guidance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The chapter is organised around the concepts of Health Benefit Groups (of conditions), Health care Resource Groups (of interventions) and the Performance Management Framework.2 The intention is that these can be organised systematically to provide a formal health care framework that identifies the needs, appropriate interventions, standards of care, outcomes and costs for the whole programme of services related to lung cancer. Sections of the chapter deal with the subtypes of lung cancer and related conditions, the relevant interventions, the expected outcomes, costs and monitoring measures. These are then brought together as an example purchasing framework in Appendix VI, which summarises and quantifies the volumes, costs and standards of services related to lung cancer.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;Initiative&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;A local enhanced service set up under PBC where a protocol determines which prostate cancer patients can receive follow-up care by their GP&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Costings&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;£50 per patient per annum for the LES, delivering a saving of £100 per year per patient compared with hospital follow-up&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Policy document&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Better healthcare closer to home&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Outcomes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A slicker patient pathway so patients have injections and follow-up done at the same time; outpatient urology appointments reduced by 50% for those practices that offered the LES&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Briefing which describes service-line reporting (SLR) and the benefits it brings.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Accurate financial reporting is a vital part of improving performance; to be effective, financial reporting and the associated systems for improving performance need to involve both the clincians and managers who make the decisions that drive productivity.&amp;nbsp; Since these are generally organised around a portfolio of services, providing greater financial transparency and autonomy for specific service-lines is a prerequisite for engaging clinicians and managers. To facilitate this, Monitor has been developing the concept of service-line reporting (SLR). SLR helps trusts develop a better understanding of the operational and financial performance of their various services and hence improve their strategic and clinical decision-making. This document describes SLR and the benefits it brings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This toolkit has been developed to help local services to deliver high quality patient education to their diabetes populations.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ To help local services meet the obligation of delivering patient education, the Department of Health, the National Diabetes Support Team and Diabetes UK have produced two Structured Diabetes Education Improvement tools&lt;/EM&gt;, in consultation with a number of stakeholders, including the Healthcare Commission. The first tool is a Structured Education Programme Improvement Tool to help local service providers to assess whether the programmes they are delivering and commissioning meet the NICE criteria, and to identify gaps in current provision, so that the programmes can be improved. The second tool is an Educator Improvement tool, which serves as an adaptable framework to enable diabetes educators to reflect on their current practice and enhance their skills. It contains a number of useful resources including a patient course evaluation.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Using thinking differently tools when starting to think about an issue, problem, challenge or project for the first time can be a very useful exercise. This approach offers a range of ways to think about and challenge the way you design your ‘shift’ project and involve people in the process. Sometimes when running projects we think at the end, “if only we had planned the communications better or talked to more people first”. The thinking differently tools provide useful ways to avoid this and involve people in the process. The tools have been tested with field sites that have worked with the NHS Institute's 'Care Outside Hospital' priority programme. &lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Optimal management of fluid balance during major surgery is considered a key factor in improving surgical outcomes. Innovative and minimally invasive monitoring of cardiac stroke volume using oesophageal Doppler technology in operating theatres now enables the anaesthetist to safely and accurately administer intravenous fluids during surgery. &lt;BR&gt;Benefits of this technology include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced risk.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Fewer complications compared with other invasive monitoring techniques. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Minimal training.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Minimal training is required for the use of the cardiac output monitors. The minimally invasive oesophageal probes are easy to insert and remove.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved patient outcomes.&lt;/STRONG&gt; As a guide for fluid replacement during major surgery, oesophageal Doppler guided fluid management ensures adequate blood perfusion to major organs, reducing the risk of hypovolaemia and post-operative complications. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced hospital stay.&lt;/STRONG&gt; By addressing the challenge of hypovolaemia, the reduced risk of complications have been shown to contribute to an overall reduction in patient length of stay.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits to patients and the NHS.&lt;/STRONG&gt; A reduction in complications will enhance patient experience. A reduction in patient length of stay will enhance efficiency and improve patient care pathways.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Widespread implementation of this technique in major surgery offers the opportunity for the NHS to deliver large scale improvements in both quality of care and productivity.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The step-by-step "How to why to Guide" provides comprehensive information on this technique and reports on the experience of NTAC's 3 clinical implementation sites currently using the technology. The Guide also explains the adoption barriers and how they can be overcome. Features include a unique easy-to-use Business Case Template, a Costing Model, and a Roadmap Section to support clinicians and hospital managers in the implementation of this technique into clinical and operational practice.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A report from a learning event held on July 17 2008 in Southwark.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This event provided a forum for healthcare professionals to discuss how human rights principles and standards can best be integrated into the commissioning process. A number of key questions were addressed including:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;what are&amp;nbsp;human rights and why are they relevant to commissioning healthcare services?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how do we ensure that human rights outcomes are reflected in the commissioning framework or service specifications?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how can we monitor human rights outcomes?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how can we best build the capacity of commissioners, providers and service users to understand the importance of human rights to healthcare?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Programme (IAPT).
No publication date available.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The IAPT Programme is a Department of Health initiative to improve access to psychological therapies. It was developed in 2005, following a white paper commitment in Our Health, Our Care, Our Say.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 2006/7, the IAPT demonstration site's core purpose was to collect evidence of delivery to substantiate the development of a business case for a national roll out of the IAPT service model.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The programme is now going to establish a number of IAPT Pathfinder sites, which will use service redesign techniques to implement a defined care pathway, service specification, and service framework. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This specification describes the mandatory features that are required of all the IAPT Pathfinder sites. The intention is to provide a broad framework which enables and encourages opportunities for service innovation of individual commissioners and providers. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The survey questioned 500 GPs and 500 hospital doctors shortly after the consultation on the health White Paper closed. It underlines the challenge facing the government in convincing doctors that the proposed reforms will improve the quality of care. It also reflects concerns that reforms may distract the NHS from the urgent task of improving productivity, with more than 40 per cent of respondants believing that GP commissioning will make it more difficult to tackle health inequalities.</description>

    <description>This paper is aimed at those responsible for commissioning and organising end-of-life care services at a local level. The paper uses evidence from The King’s Fund’s evaluation of the Marie Curie Delivering Choice Programme to highlight examples of good practice and learning for the organisation and delivery of end-of-life care across England. It provides guidance on the delivery options and ongoing challenges in the organisation of end-of-life care that can be implemented or adapted to suit local contexts of care. Many of the lessons that are presented in this paper will also provide a valuable resource for those involved in the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention (QIPP) agenda.</description>

    <description>This guide is intended to support those providing and commissioning child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in their efforts to reduce waiting times for children, young people and families. It describes approaches that services have used to reduce waiting times and provides case studies showing how they have been applied in practice and what the results were. To help smooth the path for local areas to develop their plans for reducing waiting times this guidance also clarifies how the rules on the 18 weeks referral to treatment standard apply to CAMHS.</description>

    <description>This toolkit helps PCTs improve or establish stepped-care psychological therapies services following NICE guidelines.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has one principal aim – to help primary care trusts (PCTs) implement National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders. At present, only a quarter of the 6 million people in the UK with these conditions are in treatment, with debilitating effects on society.&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT size=1&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The programme is improving health and well-being, promoting social inclusion and improving economic productivity. In 2007, 13 pilot sites around the country began to demonstrate the programme’s benefits, alongside existing psychological therapies services operating in primary care. Routine collection of outcome measures demonstrated effectiveness and service excellence. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Government is committed to improving access to psychological therapies and announced additional funding to increase services over the next three years,2 which will be phased as the workforce to deliver these services is trained. Between 20 and 40 PCTs will receive funding in the first year, 2008/09. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This toolkit is designed to help PCTs improve or establish stepped-care psychological therapies services following NICE guidelines. It is intended for all PCTs, whether or not they will receive additional national funds in the initial stages of the programme, to help them prepare to do so. It brings together a wide range of existing tools and guides in the Annex, including the NICE commissioning guide on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for common mental health problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioners are important local leaders in delivering new psychological therapies services, promoting health and well-being through strong partnerships with professionals, local government, employment services, people who use services and those who support them. This programme gives them an opportunity to collaborate with providers from all sectors to find genuinely innovative ways of meeting local people’s needs and demonstrate they are doing so through routine collection of outcomes data. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The includes positive practice examples throughout and is specifically linked to the World Class Commissioning competencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This document describes how the new local psychological therapies services, being implemented from 2008-2011, will look when the system is fully in place; it also outlines how SHAs and PCTs can make the new system happen.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The Government has recently announced additional targeted funding in the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07) to begin national roll-out of &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Bold&gt;new local psychological therapies services&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;. This will enable PCTs to implement the NICE guidelines for people suffering from depression and/or anxiety disorders. The ultimate aim is a service for each PCT.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This document describes how those services will look when the system is fully in place and outlines how SHAs and PCTs can make it happen through:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;a major &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Bold&gt;training programme &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;to produce an expanded, specialised workforce of psychological therapists, skilled in NICE-recommended therapies;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;progressive expansion of &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Bold&gt;NICE-compliant psychological therapies services&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;, in phase with the expansion in the number of trained therapists, until the whole country is covered by adequately staffed NICE-recommended services;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Bold&gt;every PCT improving its services&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;, in preparation for national roll-out, as set out in the NHS Operating Framework, and according to plans agreed with their SHAs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;In CSR07, the following funds have been allocated to IAPT:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;£33 million in 2008/09;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;a further £70 million to a total of £103 million in 2009/10;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;a further £70 million to a total of £173 million in 2010/11.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This money will be used to pay for the major training programme required to provide the required number of suitably trained therapists and to enable the progressive expansion of NICE-compliant local psychological therapies services. Each SHA will want to plan how best to achieve these changes in collaboration with the Department of Health.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This briefing is based on a review of PCT local delivery plans and Medium-Term Financial Plans (MTFPs) to identify the characteristics and activities associated with good medium-term financial planning.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Financial planning is a key element of primary care trust (PCT) management. Organisations that do not plan their finances properly are unlikely to achieve their strategic priorities or make the best use of the resources available to them.&amp;nbsp;A medium-term financial plan (MTFP) can be thought of as a financial translation of the organisation’s strategic plan and will typically cover a three to five year period. Historically, the NHS has tended to focus on annual budgets and achieving short-term financial targets. However, strategic plans cover a longer time period and require a corresponding financial plan. PCTs have in the past received three-year resource allocations from the Department of Health (DH) so that they can plan their finances in accordance with their strategic and commissioning priorities over the medium-term. This briefing is based on a review of PCT local delivery plans and MTFPs.&amp;nbsp;A sample of PCTs were visited to identify the characteristics and activities associated with good medium-term financial planning. Additionally, SHAs were contacted to obtain their views on how financial planning should be managed across health economies.&amp;nbsp;This briefing&amp;nbsp;provides a commentary on current PCT performance in medium-term financial planning. It then gives detailed guidance for PCTs to use as necessary. It is aimed at PCT finance directors, PCT Boards and all those involved in the planning process; both finance and non-finance staff.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Although the coalition government has pledged to protect funding for the NHS, the pressures to meet rising demand will put a strain on spending. Building on a previous analysis produced in association with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this paper examines the gap between the likely available funding and the level of funding required to achieve the progress projected by Sir Derek Wanless in his 2002 report for the Treasury. It sets out: the scale of the problem; strategies for managing the cost and demand pressures; strategies for improving productivity and suggests that improving productivity offers the best option for reducing the shortfall.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper suggests that the overall approach is one of ‘doing things right and doing the right things’; a number of strategies are outlined that will reduce production costs and improve outcomes; others will free up resources to be used more productively; others may lead to actual cash savings. This information will help health care leaders at national and local level to select the strategies which, together, produce more value from the same or similar resource – rather than the same for less.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The main aim of the information tool is to share a common vision of what a good service for people with LTCs, and to provide some practical suggestions for commissioners to help them achieve that vision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It sets out some appropriate actions for commissioners to consider at each stage of the commissioning cycle, to support implementation of personalised care planning and self care support for people with LTCs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A number of ‘roadblocks’ to achieving world class commissioning have been identified and set out in Annex A. In each case, examples of how commissioners have dealt with those ‘roadblocks’ have been provided, and 10 ‘Top Tips’ have been developed to help commissioners achieve a good service model.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A best practice guide.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Improving Tier 4 provision is a key part of the National Treatment Agency’s (NTA) Treatment Effectiveness strategy. There is widespread agreement within the drugs field that, with a few notable exceptions, the relationship between commissioners, referring clinicians, users and carers and the providers of Tier 4 service provision can be improved.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This guidance summarises key challenges that currently face the Tier 4 sector. It links the roles that each stakeholder group can play in jointly finding solutions and improvements. This document can be read in tandem with Models of Residential Rehabilitation for Drug and Alcohol Misusers (NTA, 2006d), Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management (Department of Health (England) and the devolved administrations, 2007), and Commissioning Tier 4 Drug Treatment (NTA, 2006b). Reference should also be made to the World Class Commissioning Programme launched by the Department of Health in December 2007 (Department of Health, 2007). World Class Commissioning will deliver a more strategic and long term approach to commissioning services with a clear focus on delivering improved health outcomes. Many of the principles highlighted in this NTA best practice guidance, notably thorough needs assessments, partnership working and user involvement are reflected in the World Class Commissioning vision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The target audiences for this guidance are commissioners and purchasers of drug services, providers of Tier 4 interventions, and user and carer groups.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This guidance does not seek to give technical, detailed guidance on possible solutions, but instead sets out the guiding principles on which local partners can seek to agree a way forward.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Summarises current problem of health inequalities and suggests some possible solutions.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The NHS Confederation is looking at health inequalities and the role of the NHS. There are many examples of innovative projects and programmes across the country where trusts and their partners are successfully targeting disadvantaged groups. The service is less good at reaching out to people not accessing servicesa nd at spreading best practice. The right health policies need to be designed at a national level to tackle inequalities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report summarises the current problem and suggests some possible solutions. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This paper proposes a set of steps health care organizations can undertake to systematically identify and eliminate inefficiencies to create a portfolio of work leading to a 1 percent to 3 percent savings in operating costs per year.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Until recently, the rationale for health care providers to undertake quality improvement (QI) initiatives rested largely on “doing the right thing”; any financial benefit resulting from QI efforts was regarded as an attractive side effect. A different approach to the business case is the systematic identification and elimination of waste, while maintaining or improving quality. Here, the aim is primarily financial; any positive impact on quality, while desired, is secondary. This paper proposes a set of steps health care organizations can undertake to systematically identify and eliminate inefficiencies to create a portfolio of work leading to a 1 percent to 3 percent savings in operating costs per year. Methods for developing a balanced portfolio of projects and for calculating and tracking cost savings are also described.]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;The booklet is designed to aid commissioners by providing some insights into the way business and industry tackles challenges which are comparable to those of the Every Child Matters programme. It does so by summarising a range of techniques and approaches that have been developed in the private sector and that appear to have the potential for being applied to the tasks faced by children’s trusts.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>HSJ supplement on world class commissioning competency 5.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;HSJ supplement on world class commissioning competency 5 - managing knowledge. Two thirds of PCTs received a level 2 for competency 5 in year one. Some areas highlighted for improvement are analysis of future needs, translation of strategic needs assessment into service design and use of qualitative patient and clinician feedback. The analysis in this supplement also demonstrates the relationship between good performance in competency 5 and good performance in the other competencies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The publication also includes the following case studies: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/news%20and%20media/Milton%20Keynes.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Case study one: Milton Keynes Observatory&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Delivering rich information on everything from crime to smoking, right down to ward level, in a model example of joined-up working.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/news%20and%20media/Rotherham.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Case study two: Rotheram PCT&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/A&gt;Leading the way in understanding precisely where and with whom it should be intervening - and where GP services are falling short.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/news%20and%20media/Nottingham.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Case study three: Nottingham City&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/A&gt;Tackling problems such as teen pregnancy with creative methods – notably benchmarking against a comparable city, Liverpool.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/news%20and%20media/Western%20Chesire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Case study four: Western Cheshire&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Developing a sophisticated understanding of which patients are most at risk, enabling it to act pre-emptively to cut emergency admissions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/news%20and%20media/Bristol.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Case study five: Bristol&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Joining three other PCTs to create an information consortium – giving it access to a team of 25 dedicated data experts, and totally new approaches to analysis.&lt;/P&gt;

A &lt;A href="http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/downloads/Learning%20the%20lessons.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Diabetes Commissioning Toolkit &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;was published in November 2006, providing tools that can be used across diabetes as a whole.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Insulin Pumps Working Group has tried to develop tools that will fit into this overall framework. Some of the information in this report will be of use to commissioners of services, and some will be of use to those providing a service. Commissioners of diabetes services will need to ensure that service providers are adhering to the NICE guidelines on pump therapy, and considering the findings outlined in this document. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The programme of Integrated Care Pilots (ICP) is a two-year Department of Health (DH) initiative. Its purpose is to explore different ways of providing health and social care services to help drive improvements in local health and wellbeing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each of the 16 pilot sites participating in the national programme has developed an integrated model of care to help respond to particular local needs. Using their in-depth knowledge of the local population, the pilots are designing services that should be flexible, personalised and seamless.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ICP programme is one of a number of initiatives looking to deliver these objectives. All pilots will be working with local organisations involved in world class commissioning (WCC) assurance Year 2, and participation in ICP should enable sites to demonstrate success against many of the competencies for WCC assurance. This document provides summaries of the work each pilot will be doing over the next two years as they explore the potential and impact of their models, whilst identifying learning and best practice to be shared with others.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This tool is for any health, social care or third sector organisation that is pursuing integrated care, for example acute and primary care providers and commissioners, mental health organisations, social services, GPs and practice-based commissioning groups.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since the programme of Integrated Care Pilots (ICP) was launched in April 2009 there have been calls for expansion. The 16 pilot sites represent a small sample of the innovative work on integration that is taking place nationally.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The objectives of the extended community are:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;encourage and facilitate the sharing of knowledge amongst a wide range of stakeholders 
&lt;LI&gt;identify innovative initiatives which are of particular national interest&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The current pilots were in part selected due to their capacity to undertake the rigorous evaluation process associated with the programme. This meant that some inovative, but less robust, projects were not selected. The intention of the extended community is to capture the experiences of those pursuing integration outside of the programme and to promote shared learning between the pilot and wider communities. The expanded community will enable more sites to set up projects working across a range of sectors, such as children’s services, education, criminal justice and housing&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report of discussions from seminar on the topic of integrated care for people with chronic diseases.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ With an aging population and an increasing prevalence of chronic disease, ever more people require care and support services from organisations that cross the boundaries of health, social care, housing and voluntary organisations. The search is on for ways to improve the coordination of patient care and to integrate services from the numerous organisations needed to deliver timely, efficient and high-quality care. To help explore these issues, the Nuffield Trust held a seminar on the topic of integrated care for people with chronic diseases. This paper summarises the discussions, drawing on the contributions made by the main speakers at the seminar about research evidence and the US experience of integration.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This report from Dr Foster focuses on the role information is playing in implementing world class commissioning standards. It relates some case studies from around fifteen pioneering organisations in commissioning and explores how good information can be the starting point for organisations to develop as intelligent commissioners. The stories neatly illustrate the way building relationships and developing new skills and processes go hand in hand with addressing the information challenges. We also look at those who are beginning to show the real power of intelligent commissioning by redesigning local services and fostering innovation.]]&gt;</body>

In summary, the following main challenges were identified:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance and Information&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Availability and use of information to support commissioners&lt;BR&gt;• commissioners lacked confidence in their use and understanding of the levers to achieve and sustain the 18 week wait&lt;BR&gt;• lack of appropriate capabilities to use information appropriately to support decision making.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance and short term capacity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;• concern around the affordability of solutions to achieve the target&lt;BR&gt;• concern around lack of capacity in key areas of the healthcare system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Behavioural and organisational change&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;• the development of different organisational relationships and behaviours consistent with system reform. For example, the changing relationship between commissioners and providers, commissioners and clinicians (acute and primary care) and PCTs and PBCs&lt;BR&gt;• having the confidence and capability to move from a reactive to strategic approach to target achievement which may involve pathway redesign.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Managing pathways&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;• a concern around reliability and availability of data&lt;BR&gt;• a lack of skills to analyse data and make reliable forecasts.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This is a report on one of the Organisational Development projects carried out by the NHS Centre for Involvement. Each of these projects looked at involvement at both a strategic and service improvement level. At the strategic level, an organisational diagnostic was conducted to find examples of good practice in involvement within a trust, and also to identify priority areas for improvement. Focusing on organisational systems, processes and resources, the diagnostic looked at how involvement can be mainstreamed across an organisation to become part of everyday practice.&amp;nbsp; At a service improvement level, a specific piece of work was designed to model best practice in involvement around a priority issue or with a specific patient/user group.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project undertaken with NHS Lewisham focused on commissioning.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"NHS organisations need to be ever aware of the duty to involve users under section 242(1B) of the 2006 Act and may achieve this by developing a strategic approach to commissioning, agreeing how, when and where to involve users and being prepared to be creative and innovative." (1) p.95 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"User involvement in the commissioning process is not well established and presently it is more likely to occur in designing services than in assessing needs or evaluating services. For example, one or two user representatives may attend a commissioning meeting, but there are many other decisions that precede or follow this stage. Much more thought needs to be given as to how best to involve users throughout the comissioning cycle." (1) p.96&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Users can often identify common-sense solutions and practical ideas for services that lie beyond the boundaries of traditional service provision. Their ideas may not have been considered by health professionals and are more likely to meet the needs of other users and deliver user-defined outcomes. Involving users in this process may help commissioners to think ‘out of the box’ and deliver innovative and patient-centred services." (1) p.98&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"World class commissioning, the operating framework for 2008/09 and the Next Stage Review reflect the shift of involvement to the forefront of the policy agenda and establish it as one of the key developmental challenges for NHS organisations. High-performing organisations are increasingly mainstreaming and embedding involvement activity in all aspects of their work." (1) p.10 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.52 "Commissioners and providers will want to work in partnership to implement systems that respond to the views and experiences of patients and improve the patient experience of services. The opportunity to have near real-time feedback of patients’ experience gives providers and commissioners an unprecedented opportunity to respond to changes and improve the patient experience." (2) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2.34 "Delivering high quality services with better value depends on PCTs taking innovative approaches to their relationships with patients and the public [...] Patients' views will be reflected in Quality Accounts and patient feedback on all services will be available on NHS Choices by December 2010. In addition, payment through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) scheme will require a patient experience element." (3)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"NHS organisations need to be ever aware of the duty to involve users under section 242(1B) of the 2006 Act and may achieve this by developing a strategic approach to commissioning, agreeing how, when and where to involve users and being prepared to be creative and innovative." (1) p.95 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"User involvement in the commissioning process is not well established and presently it is more likely to occur in designing services than in assessing needs or evaluating services. For example, one or two user representatives may attend a commissioning meeting, but there are many other decisions that precede or follow this stage. Much more thought needs to be given as to how best to involve users throughout the comissioning cycle." (1) p.96&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Users can often identify common-sense solutions and practical ideas for services that lie beyond the boundaries of traditional service provision. Their ideas may not have been considered by health professionals and are more likely to meet the needs of other users and deliver user-defined outcomes. Involving users in this process may help commissioners to think ‘out of the box’ and deliver innovative and patient-centred services." (1) p.98&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"World class commissioning, the operating framework for 2008/09 and the Next Stage Review reflect the shift of involvement to the forefront of the policy agenda and establish it as one of the key developmental challenges for NHS organisations. High-performing organisations are increasingly mainstreaming and embedding involvement activity in all aspects of their work." (1) p.10 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.52 "Commissioners and providers will want to work in partnership to implement systems that respond to the views and experiences of patients and improve the patient experience of services. The opportunity to have near real-time feedback of patients’ experience gives providers and commissioners an unprecedented opportunity to respond to changes and improve the patient experience." (2) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2.34 "Delivering high quality services with better value depends on PCTs taking innovative approaches to their relationships with patients and the public [...] Patients' views will be reflected in Quality Accounts and patient feedback on all services will be available on NHS Choices by December 2010. In addition, payment through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) scheme will require a patient experience element." (3)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This study by Age Concern London brought commissioners and service users together to discuss how service users can be involved in shaping local services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project reflected on what's happening at the moment and how user involvement in commissioning could work in practice. It found that:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The involvement of service users in shaping local services is still in its infancy.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The definition of 'user involvement' varies from one-off consultations to equal partnerships.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;There are more good practice examples of user involvement in Social Care than in Health.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>CIMA’s NHS group identified the issues associated with in-year financial forecasting as key to effective financial management of NHS organisations. To address this, a survey of current forecasting practice in the NHS was undertaken to gain more understanding. Members of CIMA’s NHS group considered and analysed the forecasting information generated by the survey responses and devised recommendations (section 5) to encourage good practice in financial forecasting. This document is for general guidance and is intended to be adapted to the individual circumstances of an organisation for consideration by finance professionals in the NHS.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Data on 25.6 million adults from the UK 2001 Census were analysed to compare the regional pattern of self-rated health of the long-term unemployed to that of people from different social classes and of those who have never worked. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The results show that the health of the long-term unemployed was better in high unemployment regions and, conversely, worse where the local labour market was traditionally stronger. This is the reverse of the regional pattern found for different social classes and for those who have never worked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;Mr Easton also gives advice on how NHS leaders can keep headroom for innovation at a time of structural upheaval and what leadership skills he sees becoming more relevant to the challenges ahead.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;'Better joining up of services at the local level&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;'26&lt;/STRONG&gt;. At the moment too much primary care is commissioned&amp;nbsp;without integrating with the social care being commissioned by the local authority. There will be much more joint commissioning between PCTs and local authorities. We will develop a procurement model and best practice guidance to underpin a joint commissioning framework for health and well-being.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;'27&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To assist this, we will streamline budgets and planning cycles between PCTs and local authorities based on a shared, outcome-based performance framework. There will be aligned performance assessment and inspection regimes. Local Area Agreements should be a key mechanism for joint planning and&amp;nbsp;delivery. There will&amp;nbsp;be a strengthened role of Director of Adult Social Care, a wider role for Directors of Public Health, and more joint health and social care appointments. Work by a new National Reference Group for Health and Well-being will provide a sound evidence base for commissioning, including evidence from the Partnerships for Older People projects.' (1)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'&lt;STRONG&gt;Commissioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'3.13 A greater focus on joint commissioning between healthcare and social care and better integration between healthcare, social care and other local government services will bring benefits for patients and service users. We are looking to PCTs, working in partnership with practice based commissioners and local authorities, to ensure that commissioning makes an increasing contribution towards supporting the needs of patients and giving them more control over their care. Strong contracting arrangements will be key to driving these changes.' (2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'1.5 Our aspiration is for better health and increased well-being for everyone. This can only be achieved by local communities in every part of the country working together to tackle inequalities and promote equality. It also means working jointly to develop services that are more personal to individuals and provided closer to home; increasingly building on a closer integration of health, social care and other service providers, helping people to stay as healthy and as independent as possible.' (3)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;'Partnership working&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'5.17&amp;nbsp; Personalised healthcare cannot be delivered without close working with local government and its partners. The planning process last year facilitated the alignment of PCT operational plans and LAAs to ensure wide stakeholder buy-in to priorities. PCTs should work with their local authorities and other partners through the Local Strategic Partnership to deliver LAAs. Delivering health and well-being in partnership: The crucial role of the new local performance framework gives details of the LAA indicators which are relevant for PCTs.'&amp;nbsp; (4)&lt;/P&gt;

Needs analysis was a driving force – matching identified need to existing services, identifying gaps in provision and services that may need to be decommissioned – in identifying shared priorities for commissioning.

&lt;P&gt;The framework is designed for people working in all sectors of children, young people and maternity services including political leaders, senior management, planners, commissioners, providers, corporate procurement, finance, legal and other support staff, central and regional government officials. This paper sits alongside the DH joint commissioning framework for health and well-being, and the ODPM Best Value guidance.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;'- Joint Strategic Needs Assessment describes a process that identifies current and future health and wellbeing needs in light of existing&amp;nbsp;services, and informs future service planning taking into account evidence of effectiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;'- Joint Strategic Needs Assessment identifies 'the big picture' in terms of the health and wellbeing needs and inequalities of a local population.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'Needs assessment is an essential tool for commissioners to inform service planning and commissioning strategies. For the purpose of JSNA, a clear distinction should be made between individual and population need. JSNA examines aggregated assessment of need and should not be used for identifying need at the individual level. Specifically, JSNA is a tool to identify groups where needs are not being met and that are experiencing poor outcomes.'&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;[...]&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'Building on the new duty place upon local authorities and PCTs and commencing 1st April 2008, the key focus of JSNA includes: &lt;BR&gt;- understanding the current and future health and wellbeing needs of the population;&amp;nbsp;over both the short term (three to five years) to inform Local Area Agreements, and the longer term future (five to ten years) to inform strategic planning commissioning services and interventions that will achieve better health and wellbeing outcomes and reduce inequalities. In particular, JSNA will address those outcomes described in both the National Indicator Set for local authorities and local authority partnerships, and the 'vital signs' referred to in 'The NHS in England: the operating framework for 2008/9'.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'The JSNA process will be underpinned by:&lt;BR&gt;- partnership working; JSNA will be undertaken by Directors of Public Health, Adult Social Services and Children's Services working in collaboration with Directors of Commissioning&lt;BR&gt;- community engagement: actively engaging with communities, patients, service users, carers, and providers including the third and private sectors to develop a full understanding of needs, with a particular focus on the views of&amp;nbsp;vulnerable groups&lt;BR&gt;- evidence of effectiveness: identifying relevant best practice, innovation and research to inform how needs will best be met.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;'JSNA is a continuous process. All contributing actors should engage with each other throughout and refine their analyses as part of this ongoing process.' (1)&lt;FONT face=AGaramond-Regular&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The document provides a useful prompt to consider where the JSNA as a strategic planning tool should go next, such as whether the JSNA should focus primarily on health and social care or if there is potential value in incorporating the wider determinants of health and involving other partners. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

The toolkit was used in a quality assurance exercise to identify key factors in producing a successful JSNA. The exercise highlighted the need to clearly define how JSNA fits with other statutory needs assessments and links to wider policy, to provide easily understood summaries that partners and the public can relate to, and to have long-term data sharing arrangements between partners.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This paper examines judicial review, a High Court Procedure for challenging administrative actions. Judicial review is a legal procedure, allowing individuals or groups to challenge in court the way that Ministers, Government Departments and other public bodies make decisions. The paper seeks to explain how claimants bring applications for judicial review and also discusses the procedures for lodging and defending a claim. It considers the statistical trends in the Administrative Court and assesses some of the conflicts that have been identified between the executive and the judiciary following claims for judicial review.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This report explores a range of practical issues and approaches in commissioning social care, in order to inform the development of a set of commissioning strategies and to draw lessons from that work which could be of benefit to other organisations.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The Exemplar project looked at commissioning social care, as distinct from social care commissioning, the emphasis being on commissioning a range of specific activities rather than describing who undertakes commissioning.&amp;nbsp; While it is&amp;nbsp;recognised that a range of organisations might&amp;nbsp;be involved in commissioning social care, under a&amp;nbsp;number of different managerial configurations, what is to be purchased and why still represents a distinct activity.&amp;nbsp;It is increasingly recognised that neither social care nor health outcomes are likely to be achieved without realising the impact that one service has on the other.&amp;nbsp; This publication explores: the range of commissioning models available and their similarities and differences; a framework for developing a commissioning strategy; a consideration of some key issues in contracting; the way forward for commissioning managers in commissioning organisations.]]&gt;</body>

Since this project began the concept of a Best Practice Tariff has been developed and endorsed. This report provides a financial basis for considering this approach to commissioning of kidney dialysis, offering an opportunity to both introduce the service into the scope of PbR and improve the quality of service through incentivising best clinical practice.]]&gt;</body>

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;How GP consortia and the NHS Commissioning Board can best involve patients in improving the quality of health services

This literature review was one component of this scoping study. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key questions that we were looking to answer from the literature were:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;• What was the scope of the earlier waiting time targets and what have been the concerns related to the achievement of these targets? &lt;BR&gt;• How have other waiting time targets been achieved? &lt;BR&gt;• What have been the challenges facing commissioners looking to achieve waiting time targets?]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This case study was developed as part of the ISIP Demonstrator Programme, which ran from the end of 2006 to September 2007. During this period ISIP supported a number of Local Health Communities engaged in different types of transformational change by providing communities with change consultants.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This is a whole health economy transformational change programme encompassing a range of providers including foundation trusts and tertiary centres. The main external driver for this programme was the Department of Health commitment to secure reduced waiting times and waiting lists for planned care, specifically to achieve the target of a maximum 18-week wait from GP referral to hospital treatment by the end of December 2008 (with an average wait of 8-9 weeks).]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A national survey of health advocacy groups.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This nationwide survey was jointly conducted by National Voices (an umbrella organisation established in September 2008 by and for the voluntary sector) and the Royal College of Nursing. The survey is one of the first efforts to discover whether patients and the public are truly involved in the government's local commissioning initiatives. The study explores the attitudes of patient groups (and other relevant voluntary organisations) to local commissioning in primary care. The intention is to look at current practice, and identify mechanisms by which commissioning processes can be improved (from the patients’ perspective).]]&gt;</body>

The review has kept a broad remit and incorporated the range of mental health problems and learning disabilities across the whole of the criminal justice system, and made recommendations to government including the organisation of effective liaison and diversion arrangements and the services needed to support them.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Looking at interventions targeted specifically at low-income groups, this paper asks which interventions are effective in getting people to quit smoking, eat healthily and exercise. It reveals that the most frequently used techniques are providing information and encouraging people to set goals, which can be particularly effective at changing behaviour in disadvantaged groups. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

It uses a literature review of commissioning in the public sector and a set of informant interviews as the basis for identifying the essential elements required of commissioning if it is to become properly effective as new primary care trusts (PCTs) are established in England in the autumn of 2006. It is intended as a research-based resource for new PCT boards as they consider how best to organise their commissioning function in the light of the new Department of Health commissioning framework.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This report examines areas for improvement in the provision of diabetes services for children and young people.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Roman&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Diabetes takes a severe toll on those who develop it. Life expectancy is reduced, on average, by 23 years in people with Type 1 and by up to 10 years in people with Type 2 diabetes. Mortality rates from coronary heart disease are up to five times higher; diabetes is the leading cause of renal failure; the second most common cause of lower limb amputation; and the leading cause of blindness in people of working age. Women with diabetes have reduced fertility and face additional risks during pregnancy, at birth and to the baby.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Much of the attention has focused on the explosive growth of Type 2 diabetes and its associated lifestyle factors in adults. However, there is a significant increase in the number of children and young people diagnosed with all types of diabetes. In the UK we have the both the highest number of children diagnosed with diabetes in Europe and the lowest number of children attaining good diabetes control. This is in marked contrast to children with cancer, where mortality and morbidity rates have improved steadily over the last few years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;This document is a report from the working group, examining areas for improvement and clarifying standards that need to be met. The report makes suggestions for key outcomes to support quality commissioning and provision. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The report is aimed at everyone who has a part to play in improving services for children and young people with diabetes up to age 25. This will include commissioners and healthcare professionals. It provides guidance on a number of areas, including commissioning, organisation and provision of services and workforce.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;'Making it happen - the third sector' was held on 12th March 2007, forming one of a range of events marking one year since publication of the white paper 'Our health, our care, our say'. This white paper identified greater third sector involvement, in both commissioning and service provision, as a key factor in realising its goals of improving health and well-being and giving people more choice, a stronger voice, and better access to a wide range of community services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The event provided an opportunity for representatives of third sector organisations to discuss the key issues facing the sector. The day included a plenary session on commissioning, along with workshops on direct payments and individual budgets, the social enterprise model and caring for people with long term needs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report details the points raised at the event, including notes taken from workshop session discussions and delegates' points from the final plenary sessions.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report from an expert working group made up of leaders from the NHS and independent sector calls for Lord Darzi’s review of the health service to ensure that at the next stage in NHS reform health professionals and managers are given much greater freedom. They must be allowed to innovate and develop services that are responsive, cost effective and continuously improving the quality of care. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The group focused on the role of PCTs as commissioners and on practice-based commissioning but discussed other issues, including patient choice. This paper includes specific proposals for government, the Department of Health, strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. These conclusions should feed into Lord Darzi's review and help to clarify the next steps for the NHS.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The white paper 'Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: a new cirection for community services' lays out the Government's vision of community-based care. In it, it builds upon the broader public sector reforms, allowing people to live more independently and to exercise greater personal choice. To deliver this, a 'shift' is required. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This review aims to help NHS and social care organisations already planning and/or implementing shifts in care. It reviews current NHS experience in making shifts of care, identifying to what extent progress has been made, examining areas of common experience and factors that are perceived as supporting or inhibiting successful change. The Institute aims to provide practical and evidence-based guidance about how to implement and accelerate changes in the system. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

This choice is underpinned by competition between health care providers; competition that is intended to be a driving force for improved quality and efficiency. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The creation, analysis and shaping of healthcare markets are therefore essential skills that commissioners must master if they are to achieve their goal of world class competence. &lt;BR&gt;...&lt;BR&gt;It is clear that PCTs are now required under the PRCC to develop commissioning strategies that will introduce more competition over time (in particular for community health services). Competition is one tool among many available to help drive improvements in quality. Commissioners need to understand when and how to use competition effectively.&lt;BR&gt;...&lt;BR&gt;The judicious use of competition is intended to increase quality of care for patients and efficiency within the health market as a whole. This is because providers are subject to 'competitive tension'. This tension, in theory, suggests that providers will fear the consequences of letting quality fall (such as loss of revenue, prestige etc. as patients or PCTs take their business elsewhere) and will have an incentive to increase quality.'

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=HelveticaNeue-Light color=#231f20&gt;This briefing paper considers the project management processes that NHS bodies need to have in place if they are to publish International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) compliant accounts for 2008/09 in accordance with the Department of Health timetable. Additionally, the paper identifies those issues that the Audit Commission believes will have the most significant impact on NHS accounts, subject to any adaptations Treasury may make to the standards in the final financial reporting manual (known as iFReM).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Meeting individual health needs and improving the health of populations within a finite budget is a challenge for health systems worldwide. Programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) is a tool for tackling this, and for putting some science behind the art of managing scarcity and competing demands. This module explores the definitions, tools and practical application of PBMA. Videos are available on:&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The study looks at the competitive dialogue process between providers and Buckinghamshire County Council in relation to client transport. This includes Home to School Transport (HtST) and transport for children with special educational needs (SEN).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Buckinghamshire County Council was spending over £20 million on client transport, of which £18m was for children and young people, significantly higher than many other similar authorities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The council therefore decided to undertake a range of activities to address this issue. These included:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;more robust monitoring of the existing system&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;reviewing policy 
&lt;LI&gt;integrating their transport planning and procurement systems 
&lt;LI&gt;testing the market (identifying both private, public and third-sector sector interest) 
&lt;LI&gt;entering into a competitive dialogue with a range of providers (including their existing in-house team). &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a consequence, an external provider has been selected. This should provide a more efficient service with improved quality and better value for money.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Maternity matters: choice, access and continuity of care in a safe service is for commissioners, service providers and other organisations involved in the provision of maternity services.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Maternity matters: choice, access and continuity of care in a safe service is for commissioners, service providers and other organisations involved in the provision of maternity services.&amp;nbsp; It builds on the maternity services commitment outlined in Our Health, Our Care, Our Say and is an important step towards meeting the maternity standard set out in the Children’s NSF.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maternity Matters describes a comprehensive programme for improving choice, access and continuity of care and it sets out a strategy that will put women and their partners at the centre of their local maternity service provision. It highlights how commissioners, providers and teams of maternity care professionals will be able to use the health reform agenda to shape the provision of services to meet the needs of women and their families. It emphasises the roles that each can play in providing women-focused, family-centred services and gives examples of what could be in place to achieve this. The key aim is to improve the quality of service, safety, outcomes and satisfaction for all women through offering informed choice around the type of care that they receive, and improved access to services whilst ensuring continuity of care and support.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Measuring social value: how five social enterprises did it
In 2009, the Department of Health, with the support of the Cabinet Office, commissioned an action research project on social value. The results aim to help social enterprises and commissioners better understand the wider impacts of service delivery and quantify the value in monetary terms. Five social enterprises delivering mainstream primary and community care services participated in the action research project.</description>

    <description>Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are common, associated with significant distress, and can result in unnecessary and costly referrals, diagnostic tests and even operative procedures. The current system for treating MUS is inefficient; resulting in unnecessary stress and dissatisfaction for both clinicians and patients in addition to the use of a disproportionate amount of time and resources.

    <description>A toolkit to help ensure safe and accessible services for patients.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Version 1 of a toolkit that aims to integrate relevant medicines considerations with the commissioning of a new service or the redesign of an existing service. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The toolkit was produced to help commissioners get medicines right. Medicines are the most common treatment intervention and almost all care pathways involve the use of medicines. The document provides a number of detailed checklists and is intended to be both accessible to commissioners and to signpost them to the PCT/PBC pharmacist for help to identify any action points. The focus of the document is on the practical aspects of managing medicines safely rather than specific prescribing issues such as h igh cost drugs, although some of the content relates to prescribing and expenditure, e.g. the funding checklist. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Cancer Reform Strategy set out the benefits both for patients and for the NHS of transforming inpatient care for cancer patients. Too many patients are being admitted as emergencies when, with suitable planning, alternative models of care could have been put in place. Once admitted, the length of stay is often unnecessarily prolonged because of failure to define and implement inpatient care pathways and because of delays in decision making. Better education for patients would lead to self management approaches which could also reduce unnecessary admissions.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Cancer Reform Strategy set out the benefits both for patients and for the NHS of transforming inpatient care for cancer patients. Too many patients are being admitted as emergencies when, with suitable planning, alternative models of care could have been put in place. Once admitted, the length of stay is often unnecessarily prolonged because of failure to define and implement inpatient care pathways and because of delays in decision making. Better education for patients would lead to self management approaches which could also reduce unnecessary admissions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Transforming Inpatient Care Programme, led by NHS Improvement – Cancer and the National Cancer Action Team, has been established to support local initiatives to improve inpatient care for cancer patients. Pilot sites are now starting to test new ideas working with partners in primary care and social care.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;‘Meeting the challenge together... delivering care in the most appropriate setting’ has been designed to support the pilot sites but will also be of interest to other organisations attempting to reform inpatient care. It builds on the ‘four winning principles’ that were identified from previous testing. Key to the success of this phase of the programme will be spread and sustainability to achieve the maximum impact. It is vital that we capture learning from individual pilot sites, both about what does and what does not work, in order that the benefits are optimised as soon as possible.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Local authorities spend about £18 billion each year on adult social care including £11.6 billion on external providers. Millions could be saved each year through more effective and collaborative commissioning, including better procurement of services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Local authorities are under pressure to reduce expenditure on, and the cost of, adult social care. At the same time, services users and carers expect high-quality services. Members need to understand how services can be improved and how they can be delivered more efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Professional services is a collective term which includes temporary agency staff and consultancy. It is the fourth biggest external spend area in local government, after construction, adult social care and waste.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As local government finances are squeezed during difficult economic times it will become even more important for councils to work together to save money and keep council tax down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ When commissioning mental health helpline services, commissioners need to be aware of the existence of a flourishing partnership (&lt;STRONG&gt;mhhp&lt;/STRONG&gt;) of over 50 local and national mental health helpline providers. This 8 minute video podcast explores the ways in which the partnership can support commissioners develop a wider range of services especially for those service users who need remote access to information, advice, talking therapies and listening services.

    <description>This Framework has been developed to support commissioners, Local Strategic Partnerships and colleagues in the development and delivery of best practice in the promotion of mental health and well-being.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This Framework is informed by the use of the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) “social model” approach to commissioning. This model of commissioning focuses on people’s strengths and coping capacities and the obstacles they face in achieving their desired outcomes – obstacles that are as much a product of their social situation as of any personal limitations or impairments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoBodyText style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT face=Helvetica&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoBodyText style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;FONT face=Helvetica&gt;Using this model, the task of commissioning becomes one of re-configuring services and interventions designed to:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This green paper asks for views on how the Government can create a level playing field for charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises that want to bid for public service contracts.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This Green Paper is a basis for discussion with commissioners, civil society organisations and other public service providers. It seeks your views on how the Government can reform all stages of the commissioning process at both local and national levels to ensure civil society organisations play a full and active part in public services. The conclusions of this discussion will form part of the commitments made in a wider Public Service Reform White Paper, which will be published early in 2011. In this White Paper, the Government is particularly keen to explore how the following could drive reform further in a range of service areas: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Promoting independent provision in key public services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Developing new rights for communities and public employees to buy and run services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Attracting external investment and expertise into the public sector to deliver better and more efficient services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Extending innovative payment and funding mechanisms, such as personal budgets and payment by results commissioning in more areas&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Increasing democratic accountability at a local level; and Maintaining continuity of service and managing risks in light of these reforms&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A commissioning toolkit for England</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This practical toolkit has been written to guide primary care trusts, practice based commissioners and local authority children's trusts in commissioning maternity services and providing support for parents during the transition to parenthood. High quality accessible services, as set out in the &lt;EM&gt;National service framework for children, young people and maternity services&lt;/EM&gt;, can make a significant contribution to maternal and infant health and to the government's broader health targets. Payment by results and new commissioning arrangements must be used to support services that improve health outcomes and well-being, and enable women to make choices.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Case studies throughout the toolkit illustrate innovative ways of improving access, quality and choice and making good use of the maternity services workforce.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>More for your money is a short guide to achieving better outcomes from NHS procurement and how social enterprises as suppliers can help you achieve this.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;More for your money is a short guide to achieving better outcomes from NHS procurement and how social enterprises as suppliers can help you achieve this. It includes case studies that illustrate how contracting with social enterprises has benefited a range of NHS organisations, as well as some best practice examples from across the wider public sector. Although much of the guide refers to the procurement environment in England, the principles of successful procurement from social enterprises apply equally in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and this guide complements work taking place across the UK.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide does not suggest that social enterprise should have an unfair advantage over other suppliers in the bidding process. Rather, that social enterprises have a valuable part to play within the context of a diverse range of suppliers. Of course, they will have to prove this to the purchaser.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is only a short introduction to procuring from social enterprises but there are a range of resources available if you want to take the next step (see the Further resources section on page 34).&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This guide sets out the case for migrant community organisations as providers of commissioned public services, both to show commissioners why they should consider them and to help the organisations themselves understand what their roles could be.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Migration is changing the face of Britain's population. It has accounted for about half of Britain's population growth in the last ten years. In the last five years, about 200,000 people have been accepted as refugees and are now settled in Britain on a long-term basis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many of these new communities have formed new organisations. They provide vital support services to their communities. But such services are often not part of any wider local or national stucture for service provision. Several groups are now providing more fully developed services - and many more would like to do so. Among other benefits, being part of a formal structure enables groups both to improve the quality of their services, and to prove that they are doing so. Becoming providers of publicly funded services may also have wider benefits in helping the integration of migrant communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide covers a comprehensive range of relevant services, including accommodation, training legal advice, physical and mental health and other support services. The guide is about public services which are commissioned from third parties - normally through competition - and operated under legal contracts. It is not about grant-aid for the third party organisations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide's main aim is to set out the case for these minority ethnic organisations as providers of commissioned public service, both to show commissioners why they should consider them and to help the organisations themselves to understand and form their own views on what their potential roles could be. In this respect the guide's aim is to change the climate of opinion - on both sides of the commissioning process - as well as to show how such a change fits in with wider government reform of the public services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Toolkit to enable NHS organisations and the pharmaceutical industry to work together in the interests of patients.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This toolkit is designed to help the NHS meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving health service by providing practical advice and tools, based on best practice, so that joint working projects with the pharmaceutical industry can be set up rapidly and effectively, reducing duplication of effort, increasing efficiency and minimising unnecessary workload and stress.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this toolkit is to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;encourage NHS organisations and staff to consider joint working as a realistic option for the delivery of high-quality healthcare and a way to drive efficiency in the delivery of services in both primary and secondary care&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;provide the necessary information and have easy access to the tools which will help to enter into joint working.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The initial version of the toolkit was published in March 2008. Following feedback from users, the toolkit has been updated to include some new templates as well as more examples of good practice for reference. This toolkit should be used in conjunction with the document “Best practice guidance for joint working between the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry”.&lt;/P&gt;

This would be achieved through the devolution of healthcare budgets to “Community Health Collaboratives”.</description>

    <description>These web pages provide details of the services on offer for OCD and some of the details about how they can be accessed.
</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Most people suffering from OCD find their lives completely dominated by this problem and are unable to access appropriate treatment because of funding issues. For the most severely affected individuals there is now a system for referral to national specialist centres which does not require approval by local funding agencies such as the primary care trust. Because funding is provided centrally, patients who meet certain criteria will automatically be accepted for relatively rapid treatment for the obsessive compulsive disorder. This specifically means that people who are accepted by the National Specialist Service will be offered evidence based treatment including cognitive behaviour therapy, medication and possibly a combination. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These web pages give details of the services on offer and some of the details about how they can be accessed. The National Commissioning Group for Highly Specialist Services (NCGHSS) of the Department of Health has commissioned a service for the treatment refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). The funding for such patients is by the Department of Health. Patients who do not meet such criteria can still be referred by the normal process and funded by their PCTs. The referral pathways and criteria which they have to meet are described in the article.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The National Obesity Observatory e-atlases are interactive mapping tools for the analysis of data on the prevalence of obesity and its determinants at Local Authority (LA) and Primary Care Trust (PCT) level in England.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The new child e-atlases enable users to view and compare data at PCT and LA level, for both single and dual maps. The adult e-atlases allow comparison at LA level for both single and dual maps.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The single map e-atlases enable users to make regional and national comparisons for a wide range of indicators.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The dual map e-atlases enable users to compare indicators including prevalence of childhood obesity using data from the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) with, for example, local area deprivation scores and NCMP participation rate. The adult dual map e-atlas includes indicators on physical activity, prevalence of type 2 diabetes and incidence of colorectal cancer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the dual map e-atlases the degree of correlation between selected variables is presented with a scatter plot and accompanying statistical equations. Users must be aware of the limitations and caveats associated with the data to understand any relationship which may be shown between data in the e-atlases. Click here for more information on these statistical methods&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A metadata and guidance document is available for each indicator providing information on the data source and an explanation of any limitations that should be considered when undertaking analysis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More indicators will continue to be added to this tool.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A key policy objective in most publicly financed health care systems is to allocate resources according to need. Many jurisdictions implement this policy objective through needbased allocation models. To date, no gold standard exists for selecting need indicators. In the absence of a gold standard, sensitivity of the choice of need indicators is of concern. The primary objective of this study was to assess the consistency and plausibility of estimates of per capita relative need for health services across Canadian provinces based on different need indicators.</description>

&lt;P&gt;'Health needs assessment is a systematic method for reviewing the health issues facing a population, leading to agreed priorities and resource allocation that will improve health and reduce inequalities.' (1)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It forms part of the World class commissioning competency to manage knowledge and assess needs:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'Manage knowledge and undertake robust and regular needs assessments that establish a full understanding of current and future local health needs....&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioning decisions should be based on sound knowledge and evidence. By identifying current needs and anticipating future trends, PCTs will be able to ensure that current and future commissioned services address and respond to the needs of the whole population, especially those whose needs are greatest. The JSNA [Joint Strategic Needs Assessment] will form one part of this assessment, but when operated at world class levels will require more and richer data, knowledge and intelligence than the minimum laid out within the proposed duty of a JSNA.'

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This is a discussion paper to assist NHS bodies that commission services in England - Primary Care Trusts, Practice Based Commissioning Groups and individual primary care practices. It aims to aid them to engage in an informed and constructive consideration of the possible implications of new business structures in health and social care. A range of new providers could be part of the future organisation and delivery of these services. The content of the paper is also relevant for members of Local Authority Health Overview and Scrutiny Committees who are charged to monitor and challenge commissioning decisions on behalf of the public.]]&gt;</body>

Some Centres are refurbished sections of existing hospitals, or new buildings and some are mobile units that travel around the country. Patients treated at any NHS Treatment Centre that is managed by an independent healthcare company are still NHS patients. Care and treatment is free and patients can expect the same level of service they would expect from the NHS. GP or local support services can give patients information about the choices that are available.' (1)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;'Treatment centres are run either by the NHS or commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs) from independent sector providers. Although capacity in the NHS is growing fast, it cannot grow fast enough to meet the ... next target of a maximum 18 week wait from referral to treatment by December 2008. This is why extra capacity is being sought through independent sector-run Treatment centres.' (2)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The House of Commons Health Select Committee has published its report on Lord Darzi's Next Stage Review. The report is in two parts: Volume 1: Report, together with formal minutes and Volume 2: Oral and written evidence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report describes the main proposals contained in the NSR and witnesses' responses to them. Chapter 2 describes the process leading up to the publication of the NSR. Chapter 3 then looks in general terms at witnesses' concerns about some of the proposals, in particular whether they are likely to be implemented successfully. Chapters 4 to 8 then addres the most significant proposals in the NSR. It examines in particular the Department's proposals to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;improve quality&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;extend 'patient choice' and 'personalisation' in primary healthcare&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;establish an NHS constitution&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;improve workforce planning and leadership in the NHS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;Better commissioning is a key element of the current NHS reform programme. It is also one of the most recent to be developed, with the initial changes to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) proposed in 2005 (including halving the number of PCTs to create larger, more powerful commissioning organisations) (1). That reorganisation took place in October 2006 and since then PCTs have been issued with a stream of guidance from the Department of Health, most of it aimed at improving the commissioning of hospital or specialist services (2, 3, 4, 5) and more recently, better commissioning of health improvement and wider preventative services in the local community or in partnership with local government (6). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a consequence of the relatively recent nature of this strand of reform, most of the literature takes the form of policy analysis, as empirically based evaluation has yet to materialise. The current attention being paid by government to improving the skills and scope of commissioners in PCTs is welcomed by many commentators who point out that this has been a neglected area of health reform until recently (7, 8, 9) and that previous attempts at improving commissioning at primary care level in the 1990s were only partially successful (7). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many of the analyses attempt to define the scope of commissioning, (7, 8, 9, 10, 11) and point out that the current vision for commissioning represents a big expansion from previous conceptions of commissioning which focused more narrowly on purchasing or contracting health services (10). The identification of health needs and local demand for health services is seen as a key function (7, 8, 9, 10, 11), followed by purchasing and negotiating contracts (8, 9, 10, 11), creating and shaping the market for different providers (7), holding the market to account (through contracts, for example) (7), monitoring the effectiveness of providers (8, 9, 11 ), engaging with the local community (8, 10) and being held to account by the local community (7) and other local stakeholders (10). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The context in which this commissioning function is being carried out is also considered to be important. Commissioners have to ensure that patients are able to exercise a choice of provider (7, 8) and act as a counterbalance to the acute sector, which faces strong incentives to expand provision under payment by results (7). There are also different interpretations of the overall aims of commissioning, with some identifying the ‘containment’ of demand for hospital services and value for money as a priority (9) while others see the current commissioning reforms as a unique opportunity to link health promotion and prevention with the core business of commissioning hospital services (12). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bulk of the policy analysis contained in the literature is devoted to identifying the key challenges to be overcome and, in some cases, suggesting solutions. Lack of clinical engagement with commissioning is identified by several analyses as having been a problem in the past (8, 11) and not all are convinced that the current solution on offer- Practice Based Commissioning- will on its own deliver more engaged GPs (11). Other suggestions include a new tier of clinical support for GPs engaged in Practice Based Commissioning and the creation of a ‘clinical executive’ for the senior management of PCTs (13). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Several analyses draw attention to the improvement needed in the information at the disposal of commissioners and the skills required to analyse the information (7, 8, 9, 10, 14). Another theme that emerges is the need to radically improve the scope and effectiveness of commissioners’ engagement with the public (7, 10). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are also calls for greater clarity from the government about the future scope of private or third sector providers and their relationship with commissioners (15) and greater clarity about what constitutes “success” for commissioning more generally (8).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Practice Based Commissioning is a mechanism to devolve commissioning to GP level, by offering GP practices the chance to hold notional budgets, redesign services to be more efficient and convenient for patients and retain some or all of any savings realised for reinvestment in the practice. Although the details of Practice Based Commissioning only began to emerge in 2004, the commitment to GP-led commissioning dates back to 1998 and many of the ideas come from the experience of GP Fundholding (and other variants) in the 1990s&amp;nbsp; (1, 2, 3).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The potential of Practice Based Commissioning (PBC) to deliver a range of benefits, including more appropriate referrals to secondary care, alternative diagnostic tests and treatments delivered outside hospital and more streamlined care ‘pathways’ for patients has been recognised (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). However, the policy is still in a very early stage of development: although the option to get involved in PBC has been available to GPs since 2005, a target for a very initial engagement by all GP practices with PBC was set for the end of 2006, known as ‘universal coverage’, which is monitored by the uptake of incentive payments rather than service redesign (1,4). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To date, therefore, there has been very little systematic evidence of how well PBC is working nationally because the policy is so new.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, there is some partial evidence available. The Audit Commission looked at the experience of GPs who were ‘early adopters’ of PBC and found that while PBC had the potential to drive positive change, considerable challenges remained, for example, engaging GPs and PCTs needing to deliver high quality and timely information about service usage and budgets to GPs (4).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other studies have used survey data to build up a picture about implementation. The most recent, a survey of GPs and GP practice managers, found that while commitment to the policy as a whole was widespread, there were complaints about poor support from PCTs, poor quality or absent information delivered to GPs and a perception that there had yet to be any real impact on care (1). An earlier survey focused on the extent of patient and public involvement with PBC and found that this was an area which needed further development, as over 70% of responding PCTs reported that there was little or no involvement(8). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some examples of what PBC can achieve in the form of simple case studies are available (3, 5, 9) with quantified evidence, for instance, of reductions in inappropriate referrals and new alternative services (although some of these examples also coincide or build on earlier initiatives, such as GPs with Special Interests GPSIs) (5). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Much more evidence is now available about the effect of the precursors to PBC (Fundholding and&amp;nbsp; Total Purchasing Pilots) (10, 11). This evidence suggests that Fundholding, for example, did appear to lead to more efficiency (reductions in elective referrals and some reductions in prescription costs) and better quality for patients in the form of shorter waits, but there was also evidence of higher management and transaction costs and greater inequalities in access to care between patients in Fundholding and non-Fundholding practices (10,11).&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This is a report on one of the Organisational Development projects carried out by the NHS Centre for Involvement. Each of these projects looked at involvement at both a strategic and service improvement level. At the strategic level, an organisational diagnostic was conducted to find examples of good practice in involvement within a trust, and also to identify priority areas for improvement. Focusing on organisational systems, processes and resources, the diagnostic looked at how involvement can be mainstreamed across an organisation to become part of everyday practice.&amp;nbsp; At a service improvement level, a specific piece of work was designed to model best practice in involvement around a priority issue or with a specific patient/user group.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project undertaken with Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust focused on commissioning urgent care.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This guide focuses on the four primary statements and notes to the accounts, which make up part of NHS trust accounts, as specified by the NHS trust Manual for Accounts.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;NHS organisations have a statutory duty to produce annual accounts (also known as financial statements) and an annual report. The trust board is required to formally approve the accounts once they have been audited and therefore it is vital that Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) understand them. Alongside this formal requirement, understanding the annual accounts is imperative if NEDs are to fully appreciate the financial health of their organisation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The format of the accounts is specified by the NHS trust Manual for Accounts and consists of: four primary statements (Income and Expenditure Account; Balance Sheet; Cash Flow Statement; Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses); notes to the accounts; statement on internal control; directors' statement of responsibilities; and the auditor's report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide focuses on the four primary statements and the notes to the accounts. Each primary statement and the key notes to the accounts are explained using an illustrative set of accounts. It is intended that NEDs will use the guide as a source of reference to look at if additional understanding is required for a particular aspect of the accounts. The guide also includes some questions that NEDs should consider before approving the annual accounts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Better for less examples&lt;/STRONG&gt;: practical examples of schemes which have been developed locally and have potential to deliver better quality at a lower cost. This month the 'better for less' examples focus on mental health.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mental health 'hot topic'&lt;/STRONG&gt;: the analyses are designed to offer insight and raise questions about variation in performance. They need to be interpreted in the local context.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;QIPP metrics&lt;/STRONG&gt;: a set of metrics to help understand system health in the tighter financial climate. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report of the group chaired by Professor Mayur Lakhani CBE</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Fair and equal access to services is a right of every NHS patient, regardless of their ethnic origin or where they live in the UK. Sometimes this means providing additional or different kinds of services, for example professional interpreters and patient advocates, to make sure all sectors of society are able to benefit from the NHS in the same way and to help patients make informed choices about their treatment and care options.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is up to individual PCTs and GP practices to work out the make-up of their local patient populations and design and commission services that best meet their needs, however this isn’t happening as well at it should. The first national GP patient survey, conducted in January 2007, found that a large proportion of BME patients, particularly Bangladeshi patients, are less happy with access to primary care services than white patients, sometimes even within the same practice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Therefore the Secretary of State for Health asked Professor Mayur Lakhani to set up a review team to find out more and suggest a way forward. The team visited GP surgeries and PCTs in areas of the country where there are lots of BME patients, and talked to staff and patients about the local health services on offer. It also set up focus groups of BME patients to get more information and it looked at key research evidence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The team’s conclusion is that there is a mismatch between the health needs and requirements of BME people and the services on offer, leading to dissatisfaction and unmet need.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The availability of expensive new health technologies, especially new drugs, combined with the increasing public awareness of them, presents a significant set of problems for local healthcare commissioners. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) have a triple challenge with regard to commissioning these new technologies: to be rational, transparent and locally accountable for their decisions. This study aimed to examine how PCTs tackle the task of engaging patients and the public in decisions about which new technologies should be funded. It examined any mechanisms developed and the problems encountered. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project was in two parts: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;• a review of existing evidence&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;• a small-scale qualitative interview study with key staff in four primary care trusts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project research was funded by IMS Health, and was carried out in 2007. It therefore preceded the World Class Commissioning framework, the publication of the NHS Next Stage Review, and the government’s review of co-payments. These developments have made the study’s findings especially relevant to the current context. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report was published in January 2009.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;As a commissioner, the Outcomes versus Expenditure Tool – Maternity and Newborn allows you to pinpoint opportunities to improve the quality of outcomes and productivity in your local area for maternity and neonatal services. You can use the tool to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Compare expenditure within a fixed area with service performance in terms of health and wellbeing outcomes.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identify where either your expenditure or performance is significantly different to that of other organisations including your statistical neighbours.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;See where you are an outlier.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Find better performing organisations you might be able to learn from about what works well and how you can replicate it.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You will also find the tool useful if you are a provider of maternity services, as a means of sparking discussion with local commissioners about ways to improve services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This independent review is based on findings from a wide consultation with stakeholders, including children and young people and their families, commissioners and service providers.  It makes recommendations for change in access to services and for their sustainability.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Children's palliative care is concerned with symptom control and maintaining quality of life, not just in the dying stages, but in the weeks, months and years before a child's death. Although it has been developed to support children and young people who are diagnosed with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions, there are strong overlaps between these children and those with disabilities. Children typically move into and out of different services depending on the progress of their condition. Palliative care needs therefore to form a thread through the lives of many children with severe disabilities and complex needs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Palliative care services for children and young children have developed over the last 25 years in a largely unplanned way. Funding has also been ad hoc and often short-term. In May 2006, concern about what would happen to hospice services once the Big Lottery Fund grants finished led to the Secretary of State for Health pledging £27m over a three-year period to support children's hospices, and the commissioning of this review.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the main aims of the reivew has been to find a more sustainable way of developing and funding services as well as looking at the availability and accessibility of these services.&lt;FONT face=Meta-Light size=3&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;PARR – short for 'Patients At Risk of Re-hospitalisation' – is a software tool that can be run daily. When an individual is admitted to hospital the tool uses the patient’s recent admissions data (up to four years) to calculate the likelihood of re-admission over the next 12 months. This takes into account factors such as prior utilisation, diagnoses and socio-demographic information and gives a high rate of predictive accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;These web pages describe a Centre for Human Settlements project for promoting participatory budgeting (PB) in Canada. The purpose of this project is to determine the possibilities and conditions under which PB can work in Canada to revitalise local democracy and help address communities' social, economic, and environmental problems. It will aim to create avenues and opportunities for mutual learning between academics, students, political leaders, business and community organisations as they analyse existing knowledge and practice in PB, create new knowledge through experimentation, and develop models for PB that work in the Canadian context. These mutual learning processes are expected to &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;-- raise public awareness about budgets and the budgetary process, &lt;BR&gt;-- promote citizenship, &lt;BR&gt;-- build community capacity for public policy engagement, &lt;BR&gt;-- enrich existing university curricula in participatory governance and planning practice, and &lt;BR&gt;-- create local alliances and national networks that could support PB practices in the future.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These web pages also contain details of the project proposal and links to other resources on participatory budgeting.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

It concludes that a modern social care workforce, which plans and commissions joined-up older people's services, is essential if social services are to meet the needs of an ageing population.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key report&amp;nbsp;recommendations include setting up older people's partnership boards with a cross departmental focus to get older people actively involved in the planning and commissioning of services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This action plan, which complements the Cabinet Office’s work on social exclusion and social enterprise, forms the next step in the Government’s long-running commitment to
ensuring that we work in equitable partnership with
the third sector.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This plan deliberately focuses on improving the day-to-day experience of third sector organisations working with front-line commissioners and procurement officers throughout the country. The plan has been jointly developed with five major central government spending departments; it identifies areas where public services are being opened to a range of providers and aims to help the third sector gain access to them. In doing so, it sets out to ensure that all third sector organisations that wish to, whatever their size, can make a contribution to public services.]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;- Create awareness of the need for public and patient engagement within our everyday activities.&lt;BR&gt;- Promote an understanding of the wider issues relating to patient and public engagement.&lt;BR&gt;- Provide practical guidance to enable staff from across the NHS, and commissioners in particular, to engage patients and the public in how services are planned, developed and delivered.&lt;BR&gt;- Support work to make services more accessible and appropriate to a wider group of people. To support this, the toolkit provides specific information on working with groups traditionally termed ‘hard to reach’.&lt;BR&gt;- Encourage a more pro-active, developmental approach to engaging people, including establishing long-term mechanisms for engagement.&lt;BR&gt;- Acknowledge existing expertise and highlight examples of good practice.&lt;BR&gt;- Support PCTs to achieve World Class Commissioning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[No publication date available]&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This survey of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) was carried out to determine their readiness to engage patients and the public in healthcare commissioning.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This&amp;nbsp;survey of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) was carried out to determine their readiness to engage patients and the public in healthcare commissioning. One third (51 out of 152 PCTs) responded. By virtue of their interest in the survey, these are likely to be among the better end of the patient and public involvement spectrum. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;While some PCTs have embarked on ambitious programmes to engage patients and the public in commissioning, many are not ready for the new challenges that confront them. They face numerous difficulties, including the following: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;deficiencies in financial and human resources and organisational capacity&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;tight timescales&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the "mindset" of clinical staff and managers who often do not value or prioritise patient and public involvement 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;lack of relevant data 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;difficulties in supporting, training and motivating the public to engage with commissioning issues 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;accessing seldom heard groups 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;insufficient incentives at a strategic level to prioritise patient and public involvement. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Guidance for local healthcare commissioners throughout the UK to handle requests from the public to go to certain other European countries for treatment which in the UK is provided in hospitals.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The purpose of this guidance is to help local healthcare commissioners throughout the UK to handle requests from the public to go to certain other European countries for treatment which in the UK is provided in hospitals. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Recognising the significance of mental health in terms of both expenditure and the overall health of the population, the King’s Fund commissioned a review. This report presents current and projected needs for mental health services and their related costs. It gives details on a number of specific disorders, including depression, schizophrenic disorders and dementia. 'Paying the price' suggests that without the right level and type of investment we will all pay the price – not just in wasted resources but also in wasted lives. This report should be used to encourage informed debate about the future nature and shape of mental health support.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This document provides Primary Care Trusts with a specification that can be used at a local level to procure board development support.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Primary Care Trust (PCT) board development has been identified as a key priority as part of the Department of Health’s world class commissioning programme. Following discussion with the ten Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs), the Department of Health (DH) has committed to leading this work at a national level. The board development work will include four main strands: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;publish a clear specification (this document) which PCTs can choose to use locally (and with other PCTs) to procure a board development programme; 
&lt;LI&gt;put in place a framework of pre-qualified providers with known ability to deliver the board development specification – by the end of August 2008; 
&lt;LI&gt;work with the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement to review their current PCT board development diagnostic tool&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;and if necessary update this to fit more closely with world class commissioning - by the end of August 2008; 
&lt;LI&gt;publish a clear statement on the role and constitution of a PCT board, along with a model of good practice - in the summer&amp;nbsp;of 2008.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The purpose of this document is to fulfil&amp;nbsp;the first&amp;nbsp;of the four strands outlined above, providing PCTs with a specification that can be used at a local level to procure board development support. The specification will also be used as the basis for the national board development framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Department of Health has commissioned the Association of Public Health Observatories (APHO) to develop a tool which helps commissioners to link health outcomes and expenditure.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The Department of Health has commissioned the Association of Public Health Observatories (APHO) to develop a tool which helps commissioners to link health outcomes and expenditure. The development of this tool and a Spend and Outcome Factsheet for every PCT in England has been led by Yorkshire and Humber Public Health Observatory. 
&lt;P&gt;Programme Budgeting is a well-established technique for assessing investment in programmes of care rather than services. All PCTs in England have submitted an annual programme budgeting return since 2003/4. The tool and factsheets use this Programme Budgeting data and overall indicators of health outcome by programme (where available) to present PCTs with an analysis of the impact of their expenditure. This allows easy identification of those areas which require priority attention, where relative potential shifts in investment opportunities will optimise local health gains and increase quality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ability to link expenditure and outcome is explicit in two of the World Class Commissioning competencies; '6 prioritise investment' and '11 make sound financial investments'.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;PCTs can use the tool and the factsheets to gain an overview of outcome and expenditure across all programmes. &lt;A href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/Programmebudgeting/DH_075743" target="_blank"&gt;The Department of Health programme budgeting spreadsheet allows further exploration of spend by programme and sub-programme.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/Programmebudgeting/DH_075743" target="_blank"&gt;NHS users can use the programme budgeting atlases to explore the relationship between spend and outcome within a programme&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You can choose to either download the Spend and Outcome Factsheet for your PCT or to go to the Spend and Outome Tool which allows you to explore the data in greater depth and to download the Spend and Outcome Factsheet for your PCT. We have produced a user guide, should you need help interpreting the charts in the profile.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

Please note that as five PCTs have yet to publish their results, the report is not yet comprehensive but it will be updated when these results are available. The results of the analysis show improvement since the first year of the WCC assurance process and this reflects well on the progress that PCTs have made over the past 18 months.</description>

Every PCT is reponsible for commissioning the full range of health services for its population, working in partnership with pratice-based commissioners. Most PCTS also directly provide many community health and other services and will continue to be free to do so, with appropriate governance arrangements which provide a proper distinction between their commissioning and providing functions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

PCTS cannot hand over the accountability for the commissioning functions to others; equally they cannot achieve their goals without close partnership with others such as local authorities. PCTs will need to work closely and effectively with primary care practices and other clinicians (including dentists, pharmacists, opticians and other front-line staff), patients and the public and local government.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Perinatal mental health is now recognised as a major public health concern. Mental health problems during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatally can have an adverse effect on the mother-baby relationship and can impact on the child's development.

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This article alerts readers to significant changes in the delivery of public services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The personalisation agenda is driving huge changes in public services. It’s also about much more than changing or even transforming service systems and processes. At its heart it’s also about a fundamental change in the relationship between citizens, communities and the state. It therefore has important implications for the local third sector and local infrastructure organisations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper outlines what the personalisation agenda is, explains key developments, discusses potential implications and considers what local infrastructure organisations can do. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Smart commissioning is critical to achieving the vision spelled out in Putting People First. It requires a transformation in the commissioning role in terms of the investments commissioners make, the markets they work to shape and the relationships they seek to build to meet local needs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioning in a world of transformed social care is a different but no less important task. As councils disaggregate increasing proportions of their investments to individuals to make their own purchasing decisions, commissioners will need to find ways of working in partnership with providers to ensure a good range of choices and the right types of support for personal budget holders and self-funders. This will often mean a need for innovative services which better respond to individuals’ purchasing decisions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are two main tasks for commissioners delivering personalisation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;ensuring the right balance of investment between different services – aggregated and disaggregated investments 
&lt;LI&gt;shaping the market – so that high-quality, flexible and responsive services are available for personal budget holders and self-funders&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Both tasks must be underpinned by the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and involve a co-productive approach to engaging people using services in their design, delivery and evaluation.Local Area Agreements are an important vehicle for securing the sign-up of partners to targets derived from the JSNA.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Tool for local councils with social services responsibilities with partners (such as mental health trusts).
[No publication date available]</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This tool is for local councils with social services responsibilities with partners (such as mental health trusts). It aims to help them better understand what is required to transform social care systems from current models to a 'self-directed support' model that will support the delivery of the personalisation agenda. It draws on the learning so far from experience of implementing direct payments, the Individual Budget Pilot Programme and In Control. It aims to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Help councils, partner agencies and organisations identify their progress to date, including achievements and areas where further scoping, planning and developmental work is required. 
&lt;LI&gt;Suggest useful early activities and sources of guidance to increase their 'readiness' to embark.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This exercise fits alongside the &lt;A href="http://networks.csip.org.uk/Personalisation/PersonalisationToolkit/?" target="_blank"&gt;Personalisation Toolkit &lt;/A&gt;which provides guidance and examples for councils embarking on transformation of their services to deliver personalisation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[No publication date available]&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>One in a series of seven papers on market facilitation.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This paper (third in the series) reflects commissioners’ and providers’ views of the market and how to promote constructive relationships. It seeks to show that in many ways commissioners and providers may have much more in common with each other than they often suggest and that engaging in dialogue outside normal negotiations about contracts can prove beneficial. Hopefully a redefined relationship between commissioners and providers can be stimulated by the discussion here as well as by the development of a new set of relationships as outlined in Paper 2: A model for market facilitation.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Guidance for primary care trusts on how to produce PNAs in the broader context of world class commissioning.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;NHS Employers has developed new guidance for primary care trusts on how to produce PNAs in the broader context of world class commissioning. The guidance is aimed at directors of commissioning and pharmacy leads in PCTs, to help them develop a plan for how they will prepare their own PNA to deliver improved services for patients in their local area. It will also be of interest to providers of pharmaceutical services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guidance covers:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;why and how PNAs should be integrated into PCTs' existing business and commissioning cycles 
&lt;LI&gt;how PNAs fit within the world class commissioning framework&lt;BR&gt;the key pointers on how to write a PNA 
&lt;LI&gt;how robust PNAs can be used to inform and sustain decisions on applications to provide services, and for workforce development 
&lt;LI&gt;how PNAs can be used to support the provision of existing pharmaceutical services and extending the services that are provided by pharmacies 
&lt;LI&gt;specific criteria and indicators of performance levels for the world class commissioning competencies particularly relevant for PNAs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;This 17 minute podcast will be of particular interest to commissioners in Local Authorities and Health. It explores the progress, impact and implications for practice-based commissioning (PBC), including in partnership. The discussion is between Rod Craig, Head of Services for Older People and Adults with Disabilities, Southwark Health and Social Care, Dr Nav Chana, GP, Member of the National Association of Primary Care Executive and Brian Skinner, Chief Executive of Southampton City Primary Care Trust and is facilitated by Robin Lorimer, Associate of the Integrated Care Network, CSIP.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The podcast spans the general challenges for general practice and community-based care through PBC and offers the context for service improvement through an integrated approach. It includes reference to examples of how PBC is being used to focus on design for well-being and care outside of hospital.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Department of Health has updated the toolkit that can be used to determine weighted capitation indicative budgets at practice level. This guidance sets out the changes.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;PCTs are responsible for ensuring that practices receive an indicative budget that reflects the needs of their population as accurately as possible. This allows a practice to access a 'fair share' of the resources available to the whole of the PCT for its patients. The Department of Health has updated the toolkit that can be used to determine weighted capitation indicative budgets at practice level. To accompany this toolkit, guidance has also been produced which sets out:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;changes to the recommended methodology for deriving practices' fair shares for 2009/10 &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;changes to the minimum pace of change to practices' budgets for 2009/10 &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;information on how to use a new toolkit that can help PCT set budgets&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A review of the activity of five Practice Based Commissioning consortia in three Primary Care Trusts.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report contains the results of a study of five Practice Based Commissioning (PBC) consortia in three 'early adopter' PCTs. Overall, it was found that PBC is becoming established in all of the study sites. A considerable amount of activity is taking place, and some changes in service organisation are beginning to occur and a diversity of organisational forms has been adopted.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reorganisation of PCTs has delayed or complicated the development of PBC in some areas, and progress was greatest in the PCT that had not undergone reorganisation in 2006. GPs are engaging with the process, although this is variable, with small groups of highly motivated GPs leading in most consortia. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some scepticism was found, particularly relating to whether or not PBC as a policy will last over time, but little active opposition was found, even among those idealogically opposed or not actively engaged. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Establishment of new working relationships was slow in some areas, and it is not yet clear whether the difficulties identified will be overcome in the longer term. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Practice based commissioning resource for primary care pharmacists.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Practice Based Commissioning (PBC) is the hot topic within primary care but what does it actually mean for pharmacists and what resources are there to help understand this new way of working? For many pharmacists, involvement in PBC will have been limited to date and many of the documents related to PBC do not recognise the valuable input that pharmacists can make in both the commissioning and the provision of services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At a national level many representative bodies are lobbying for the involvement of pharmacists in PBC so now is a good time for pharmacists to get involved locally.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This document covers practice based commissioning, the benefits for pharmacists, the risks of not getting involved, what needs to happen locally, primary care pharmacy and useful links. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;Key points:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;PbC was intended to increase the involvement of primary care clinicians in commissioning in order to improve local health services and health outcomes 
&lt;LI&gt;the response to the PbC policy has been lukewarm 
&lt;LI&gt;in a mature system, PbC would not be a separate policy area. Instead integrated clinical commissioning would be a core part of both PCT and practice business 
&lt;LI&gt;to achieve this, debate around PbC needs to refocus on the outcomes it is intended to achieve 
&lt;LI&gt;a set of principles for developing integrated clinical commissioning may help PCTs and practice based commissioners work together to deliver the vision for PbC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Practice-based commissioning (PBC) is one of the cornerstones of health policy reform, but has it delivered its intended benefits? Its objectives were to encourage clinical engagement in service redesign and development, improve services for patients and make better use of resources. Through in-depth interviews with GPs, hospital and primary care trust staff in four sites, this report assesses the progress of PBC and identifies the barriers that are limiting success. Using the evidence from the four case studies and from previous research, it suggests ways forward for policy-makers.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This paper considers the current state of PBC implementation and how it might be driven forward within the NHS.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The King's Fund and the NHS Alliance have published the results of a small sample poll of GPs and practice managers on the implementation of practice based commissioning. The key findings include:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;- Only 3 per cent of respondents felt that their PCT involves them in strategic planning to a ‘great extent’ and 21 per cent to ‘some extent’. &lt;BR&gt;- 33 per cent said that the support given to them by their PCT was ‘poor’ with only 30 per cent considering it ‘quite good’ or ‘very good’. &lt;BR&gt;- Only 4 per cent found their PCT ‘very responsive’, but 19 per cent said that their PCT was ‘not at all’ responsive to issues raised by them. &lt;BR&gt;- 70 per cent said that they had not agreed a budget for PBC with their PCT for the last financial year (2006/7). Of those who did have a budget, just under 60 per cent did not understand how it had been set. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report concludes that there are a number of practical challenges to overcome first if PBC is going to be effective, such as ensuring GPs have access to accurate and timely data about costs and hospital usage, and keeping front-line clinicians engaged.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Objective was to develop and evaluate an evidence-based tool for predicting the likelihood of emergency admission to hospital of older people aged 75 years and over in the UK.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Practice based commissioners must recognise that admission-avoidance schemes need to feature heavily in their redesign plans and for these to work, they must be targeted at the right people, creating a need for a simple tool that predicts future risk of admission. This study develops and validates a simple to apply tool (EARLI) for identifying older people in the UK who are at risk of having an emergency admission within the following 12 months.&amp;nbsp;]]&gt;</body>

This is a fast-moving policy environment: please bear in mind that the framework outlined in this document is subject to refinement and change as the proposals progress.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Conservative Lib-Dem Coalition Government released its long-term vision for the future of the NHS in July in the White Paper ‘Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS’. The Government has decided that, in order to shift decision-making as close as possible to individual patients, power and responsibility for commissioning services will be devolved to local consortia of GP practices. This change will bring together responsibility for clinical decisions and for the financial consequences of these decisions. This will reinforce the crucial role that GPs already play in committing NHS resources through their daily clinical decisions – not only in terms of referrals and prescribing, but also how well they manage long-term conditions, and the accessibility of their services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the light of these proposals, GPs will need to give thought to designing appropriate arrangements to respond to this new agenda. This special report from TPP Law provides some guidance on how GPs can plan for the opportunities ahead and highlights some of the risks and challenges to be addressed. This is a fast-moving policy environment: please bear in mind that the framework outlined in this document is subject to refinement and change as the proposals progress.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Part of the world class commissioning suite of practical guides, this document builds on existing good practice within the NHS to support PCTs in improving the accessibility and responsiveness of local GP services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This is part of a series of supportive guides to help Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) become world class commissioners of primary care services. They have been co-produced by NHS East of England, NHS Primary Care Commissioning (NHS PCC) and the Department of Health (DH).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide focuses on commissioning accessible and responsive GP practices and supports the previously published guide on improving the quality of commissioning GP services. It builds on, and should be read in conjunction with World Class Commissioning – Improving GP Services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide provides practical advice on:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;• mapping the baseline – how PCTs can assess their current performance on access&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;• developing the vision – how PCTs can craft a vision for the future&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;• making it happen – how PCTs, practices, the SHA and the Department can improve access.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide forms part of a rolling programme including other guides and a series of regional events. All are intended to support PCTs in addressing the strategic, leadership and operational challenges involved in driving up the quality of primary care commissioning and contracting.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Help commissioners and providers consider, as a starting point, an integrated approach to enhanced service provision in primary care. 
&lt;LI&gt;Describe the key requirements for a holistic, enhanced service – eg. appropriate processes, improvements in health outcomes, service inputs and outputs, staffing competencies, integrated governance, information etc. 
&lt;LI&gt;Give an opportunity to consider which level of this enhanced service provision and contractual route(s) would be most appropriate to adopt locally, such as GMS, PMS, APMS or PCTMS , with the most appropriate providers available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this framework on alcohol services is:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;to equip commissioners, providers and practitioners with the necessary background knowledge, service and implementation details to safely deliver support for alcohol interventions in primary care

&lt;LI&gt;as a means of improving patient's health and quality of life by providing patient-centred, systematic and ongoing support 
&lt;LI&gt;to reduce the reliance on secondary care services and increase the provision of care in a primary, community or home environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this Primary Care Service Framework on vascular checks&amp;nbsp;is:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;to equip commissioners, providers and practitioners with the necessary background knowledge, service and implementation details to safely deliver a high quality, integrated vascular checks service in primary care and the wider community setting 
&lt;LI&gt;to improve the health and quality of life for people aged 40-74 by providing person-centred, systematic, integrated risk assessment and management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The framework has been designed quite deliberately to encourage innovation and flexibility on the part of the provider(s) and the part of the commissioner.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A performance tool is being developed to assist PCTs with the implementation and monitoring of this service &lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This guide focuses on the four primary statements and notes to the accounts, which make up part of PCT accounts, as specified by the PCT Manual for Accounts.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;NHS organisations have a statutory requirement to produce annual accounts (also known as financial statements) and an annual report. The PCT board is required formally to approve the accounts once they have been audited and therefore it is vital that Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) understand them. Alongside this formal requirement, understanding the annual accounts is imperative if NEDs are to fully appreciate the financial health of their organisation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The format of the accounts is specified by the PCT Manual for Accounts and consists of: four primary statements (Operating Cost Statement; Balance Sheet; Cash Flow Statement; Statement of&amp;nbsp;Recognised Gains and Losses); notes to the accounts; statement on internal control; directors' statement of responsibilities; and the auditor's report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide focuses on the four primary statements and the notes to the accounts. Each primary statement and the key notes to the accounts are explained using an illustrative set of accounts. It is intended that NEDs will use the guide as a source of reference to look at if additional understanding is required for a particular aspect of the accounts. The guide also includes some questions that NEDs should consider before approving the annual accounts.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>An NLGN white paper.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) were created by the Department of Health&amp;nbsp; (DH) in 2002 to oversee the commissioning of primary care. As such, they commission 80% of healthcare, covering the services of GPs, dentists, opticians, pharmacists, and NHS walk-in centres. Their purpose was to achieve a greater degree of local freedom and decision-making power in health and well-being provision, to reduce health inequalities and improve the health of the community. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However many PCTs have struggled to fulfill these criteria. This paper argues that PCTs should be freed from central management control and national targets relaxed in order to empower local communities to play a greater role in defining the structure and priorities of their healthcare services. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Guide aimed at new providers, including social enterprises or commercial companies, to offer services to registered patients alongside traditional general practice.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;One of the key objectives set out in the White Paper,&amp;nbsp;'Our health, our care, our say', is to secure better access to general practice.&amp;nbsp; In some places this will mean encouraging or allowing new providers, including social enterprises or commercial companies, to offer services to registered patients alongside traditional general practice.&amp;nbsp; This guide is aimed at those new providers, or potential primary&amp;nbsp;medical services contractors. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide offers an introduction to primary medical services contracting and the surrounding regulatory framework. It also provides helpful insights into the issues that potential contractors will have to consider and describes the process by which potential contractors might secure a primary care contract.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide also provides signposts to where more detailed information can be found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;A guide designed to help PCTs identify and prioritise initiatives and build them into a comprehensive programme for change.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement has worked with a number of health communities across the country over the past two years to develop methods and approaches that will enable PCTs to build the necessary change to services into their local commissioning plans and then accelerate the spread and adoption of effective, evidence-based change across a wide range of services. One component is the strategic planning process (called Prioritise Commissioning Opportunities) detailed in this guide, which, along with the tools developed to support it, is designed to fit seamlessly into the work that your PCT will already have to undertake in order to create the Operating Plan.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document/tools include:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A range of techniques to identify and prioritise which initiatives will be taken forward into a comprehensive change programme.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Situation it works well in:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The Prioritise Commissioning Opportunities process is undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team of 18-24 people from across the local health community.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Target audience:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Prioritisation Coordinators&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note: Full access to this product is restricted to those with an NHS email address in England.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Provides an overview of the complexity of allocating resources in an increasingly demanding and politically sensitive environment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the key skills for commissioners is the ability to identify priorities. It is still the case that a large amount of the resources committed reflect historic patterns of provision, the particular approach of local providers or even&lt;BR&gt;individual clinicians. To change this there will be a need for high-quality, evidence-based and systematic decision making to support the development of the commissioning plan and to feed into the annual contracting round.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this report is to support the development of decision making in this difficult area. Although it is aimed primarily at those directly involved in resource allocation, the series should also be helpful to a wider audience including providers and policy makers.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The guidance sets out key procurement techniques commissioners can use to ensure the appropriate use of resources when commissioning services. This process needs to be much more than a simple tendering exercise and requires specificity at all levels, from the definition and specification of services through the contract awarding phase and into contract monitoring and settlement. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;A guide designed to help you when you are tasked with the responsibility for leading a project team from project start-up through to successful project delivery.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Project Delivery for Commissioners User Guide provides detailed end-to-end guidance for working through the process of setting up and delivering a service change project, as well as for using the extensive range of supporting tools and techniques available from the NHS Institute website. It also provides detail on who should be involved at various points in the process, explains the activities that will need to take place and highlights examples from the health communities who helped design the approach.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Document/tools include: A range of technqiues tools and techniques designed specifically for use during the project delivery process&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Situation it works well in: The approach to project management presented in this guide has been developed by the NHS Institute. Developed through experience gained through a range of service change projects in a number of PCTs and health communities, Project Delivery for Commissioners is based upon a ‘gated process’ to ensure projects are focused and managed to deliver the intended benefits.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Provides population data by age band, gender, ethnic group, and by disability living allowance and guardianship for English local authorities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Prevalence rates from research have been used to estimate the impact of: learning disability, including living with a parent, Down's syndrome, challenging behaviour, autistic spectrum disorders; moderate or serious physical disability including personal care, stroke, diabetes, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and those unable to work; mental health problems including depression, neurotic, personality and psychotic disorders, drugs and alcohol, suicide, adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and early onset dementia.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, nationally available performance data on helped to live at home and supported residents in care homes, are applied to the projected population figures.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Published in March 2008, the second of a series of papers from the BMA on the future of the NHS in England in its sixtieth year looks at the concept of public and patient involvement, focusing on the new mechanisms that are being put in place as part of a drive to give local communities more say in commissioning services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The BMA’s verdict is that they are at risk of having the opposite effect, and that patient voice is in danger of being seriously weakened. If the involvement of ordinary people in their health service is genuinely to increase, they need far more effective fora for expressing their views. This paper outlines one way in which that might be achieved and it is hoped it will provide a stimulus to the public, the profession and, particularly, to the government.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This is one of a series of seven guidelines produced by INVOLVE providing information about public involvement in research commissioning.

Involvement in research refers to active involvement between people who use services, carers and researchers, rather than the use of people as participants in research (or as research ‘subjects’). If research reflects the needs and views of the public, it is more likely to produce results that can be used to improve health and social care services.]]&gt;</body>

This report attempts to assess the impact of that policy approach, in particular looking not just at the effect on government and on the sector, but more importantly the effect on service users and the public at large.]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;test the JSNA processes and practices to their limits, and&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;offer practical refinements to the JSNA process for its future&lt;/LI&gt;

In each area, a GP commissioning organisation has been successfully established and is now redesigning aspects of care and making decisions that affect how NHS funds are spent. It explores how GPs, managers and other colleagues have been able to overcome barriers to progress and seeks to establish what learning has arisen that will be of use to GPs and managers in other localities as they increase their activity around GP commissioning.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ National Consumer Council (NCC) research on the experiences of users illustrates the gap that still exists between the rhetoric of putting consumers at the heart of public services and the reality. There are examples of good practice and competent staff in all services and sectors delivering public services but research findings show that many are not providing the kind of service criteria that consumers prioritise. They want to feel trust in public service organisations and welcome a sense of community. The research looked in detail at user experiences in three public service areas: employment; domiciliary care for older people; and social housing, and covered organisations in the public, third and private sectors. There was some evidence of excellence across the three service areas, particularly in the case of employment services delivered by third sector organisations, but there was little sign of consistency. In housing services neither public nor third sector landlords came out very well in terms of meeting the consumer-led criteria. Private sector providers came out best in domiciliary care services for older people but there was more consistency across private, third and public sector providers here than we saw in employment services.]]&gt;</body>

They help in assessing where risks lie and can play a key role in providers’ own internal monitoring as well as informing&amp;nbsp; the commissioning of services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first wave of QRPs are those relating to NHS trusts – as they were the first providers to be registered under the new system. These trusts will get to view their updated profile each month from September 2010 and can access the password-protected website where they are held from this page. Lead commissioning primary care trusts– as well as strategic health authorities and Monitor will also have access to QRPs from October 2010. This will enable them to view the highlighted risks at these providers&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ This report draws on the experiences of West Midlands PCTs and provider organisations as well as those further afield to build up a picture of current practice in the NHS and in private industry. The report notes that while the use of real-time methodologies has a definite and beneficial role within engagement, organisations must ensure it is part of an overall strategy and that robust processes are in place for co-ordinating data collection, its collation, analysis and dissemination. The report also emphasises the need for feedback to result in action and for that action to be publicised.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people experience a number of health inequalities which are often unrecognised in health and social care settings. These briefings are intended to show that LGBT people can be younger, older, bisexual, lesbians, gay men, trans, from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities and disabled, and to dispel assumptions that they form a homogeneous group.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The briefings provide easy to read guidance for health and social care commissioners, service planners and frontline staff. They aim to inform the delivery of appropriate services and to support health and social care professionals in their everyday work with LGBT people by providing fundamental awareness and evidence of LGBT needs in relation to health. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;It sets out the steps that Solihull took to address the situation and achieve 11% savings on the placements budget. These improvements were achieved through a combination of developing the authority's foster care service, redefining the commissioning and contracting team into a professional procurement service, and improving management of the external market.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;It&amp;nbsp;aims to set out the key guiding principles for the establishment, objectives and continuing progress of referral management schemes. It is intended to cover all such schemes including Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services (CATS), and Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services (ICATS) and the like. The term referral management scheme should be taken to apply to all arrangements that incorporate any intermediary level(s) of triage, assessment and treatment between traditional primary and secondary care including paper-based screening systems (or their electronic equivalent).&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Fertility services pose particular challenges for commissioners. These challenges arise from the diversity of providers involved, the social value judgements that sometimes need to be made in commissioning and the rapid pace of technological change.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This document is to assist NHS commissioners in developing their services. It sets out the background to fertility services, describes what they comprise and how they are accessed, and outlines an approach to commissioning them. It includes a spreadsheet model to assist commissioners in gauging likely levels of uptake.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sections 3 to 6.8 are intended mainly to inform commissioners about the background and issues raised by this service. By contrast, sections 6.9 to 6.11, 7 and 8 provide guidance on what and how to commission.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The aid is designed to complement the World Class Commissioning cycle (refer to Annex A). It concentrates on those parts of the cycle where support to commissioners is likely to be most useful.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>International experience demonstrates that integrating healthcare services can deliver more efficient, patient-focused care. The White Paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS, provides an opportunity to develop integrated care systems. In the UK, a number of health and social care organisations are at the forefront of this initiative, but there are several policy barriers to be overcome if these systems are to be adopted more widely. This briefing uses five cases studies of health economies in the English NHS and examines how local clinicians and managers are working together to develop more coordinated services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;International experience demonstrates that integrating healthcare services can deliver more efficient, patient-focused care. The White Paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS, provides an opportunity to develop integrated care systems.

This briefing uses five cases studies of health economies in the English NHS and examines how local clinicians and managers are working together to develop more coordinated services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The authors conclude that the reforms outlined in the NHS White Paper, such as handing groups of GPs commissioning responsibilities, accompanied by real budgets, have the potential to deliver more seamless care for patients. However, the experiences of the areas studied – Torbay, Nottingham, Redbridge, Trafford and Cumbria – indicate that policy in areas such as GP commissioning and local leadership, competition, incentives and regulation needs to be developed to better support moves towards integration. They also stress the need to involve both clinicians and members of the public in service redesign. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This guide has been developed to assist public sector bodies to assess the effectiveness of their reporting of financial management information to boards.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Good financial management and financial governance are at the core of good management. They help to drive performance by supporting effective decision making, aiding the efficient running of organisations and maximising the effective use of resources. Good financial management is also essential to maintain the stewardship and accountability of public funds. The way government bodies collect, analyse and utilise financial management information directly impacts on the performance of their organisations and the delivery of their objectives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How accounting officers and their boards use financial management information is therefore critical to delivering value for money from public funds. To allow the board to fulfil its responsibilities effectively, the financial management information that they receive must be fit for purpose in terms of scope, quality and presentation and be clearly linked to the organisation's performance against its objectives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guide has been developed to assist public sector bodies to assess the effectiveness of their reporting of financial management information to boards. It considers the scope, quality and presentation of financial information provided to them to run the organisation. It is designed to help organisations and their board consider whether their current processes for reporting financial information are fit for purpose and represent best practice.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The primary purpose of this review is to propose improvements to commissioning arrangements for specialised services in England. The review recommends changes to structure, organisation and powers that will ensure the commissioning process is robust and fair, is understood by all, engages patients and offers optimal value for money. Realisation of the full potential of the system reforms will depend critically on providing commissioners of the future with the essential levers and tools for success.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Commissioners should be able to demonstrate that optimum health benefit is achieved from the services commissioned for their population. Specifically, an effective commissioner should:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Safeguard access for patients to the full range of services and manage demand for scarce resources and expertise 
&lt;LI&gt;Stimulate supply and control the entry and exit of providers to maintain safe and high quality services 
&lt;LI&gt;Promote contestability and value for money&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The review has considered:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Commissioning levers and opportunities 
&lt;LI&gt;Patient and public input 
&lt;LI&gt;Monitoring commissioning performance 
&lt;LI&gt;Profile of commissioning 
&lt;LI&gt;Attributes of successful commissioners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

    <description>This report provides information on the results of a joint study undertaken by the Department of Health's Reducing Burdens Team and the Health and Social Care Information Centre on the wider impact of data collections, regardless of source, on NHS staff.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;In 2004/05, the Department of Health (DH) undertook a major review of its information collections with the aim of reducing the burden on NHS staff. The review produced cuts of about one third in information collected by the centre, but anecdotal evidence showed that front line staff were not feeling the benefits. As part of this ongoing initiative to reduce the burden of bureaucracy and in response to frontline staff concerns, DH commissioned Dr Foster to study the wider impact of data collection on NHS staff from all sources, both internal and external. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Though based on a small sample of organisations and staff and with a limited remit, the study has been the first attempt to provide a factual basis against which the anecdotal evidence from frontline staff about the burden of collection could be assessed. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>A brief review of the literature and materials available to professionals to assist in the implementation of the NHS Plan directive for antenatal and neonatal sickle cell and thalassaemia screening programmes.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P align=justify&gt;To support the implementation of the NHS Plan directive for antenatal and neonatal screening programmes, a brief review of the literature and materials available in 2004 was undertaken. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;A postal survey of one hundred and twenty four Acute NHS Trusts, thirty six sickle cell and thalassaemia centres, eight voluntary organisations or affiliates and twenty named specialists working in sickle cell services in the USA was performed. For the sake of completeness an internet search for literature was also undertaken. The aim was to establish what literature is currently available pre- and post-screening, as well as for health professional education and community awareness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;66% of NHS Trusts responded; 86% of sickle cell and thalassaemia centres; 50% of international organisations and 100% of voluntary organisations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;The literature that is currently available in England has been developed from a range of sources, mostly in isolation from each other. The quality of the information provided is therefore variable and has generally not been piloted in the target population prior to use. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;51% of units do not give any pre-screening information antenatally; but 73% of the units who responded (59 of 81) give some information to carriers post screening. The areas which are best served tend to be the high prevalence areas which have the support of specialist practitioners to follow up screening results. &lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) is a recognised tool for commissioning healthcare. The objectives of this project were to test the acceptability, data availability and practical value of PBMA within the sphere of mental health. The PBMA methodology was applied to the consideration of Norfolk Primary Care Trust's National Health Service expenditure on mental health for 2006/7.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project successfully attracted the interest of, and contribution from, important stakeholders with the exception of general practitioners. The process led to the identification of areas for disinvestment, releasing funds to be made available for the new services, or enhancement of existing services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Third report of hte joint chief inspectors' review of arrangements to safeguard children. This report looks at arrangements for safeguarding children and young people in four key areas:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the effectiveness of the overall safeguarding systems and frameworks that are in place&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the wider safeguarding role of public services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the targeted activity carried out to safeguard vulnerable groups of children; this includes updated evidence on the groups considered in the previous report, including asylum seeking children, children in secure settings, looked after children and children treated by health services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the identification of and response to child protection concerns by relevant agencies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report highlights what has improved over the past three years and assesses to what extent the considerable activity that has taken place at both national and local levels has affected outcomes for children. It also identifies those areas that are still in need of improvement. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Elizabeth Hankin at Devon Primary Care Trust has produced this straightforward suite of materials to help facilitate involvement and engagement with patients, carers, service users and the public.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The pack is in 3 parts and is easy to follow. It's been worked on with members of the public, the voluntary sector and staff who have been involved, are involved, or are involving, to identify and highlight what they have learned as best practice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Includes the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the statement of trust PPI intention - what standards the Trust undertakes to uphold when involving members of the public in Trust work 
&lt;LI&gt;first conversations - talking about what needs to be talked about and agreed to make effective and productive involvement 
&lt;LI&gt;doing it - the necessary and uncomplicated follow-up stuff to make involvement organisationally and individually safe for all&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <description>This document provides key recommendations for developing and sustaining quality services to meet local needs for people with learning disabilities, challenging behaviour and mental health needs.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The first version of this report (1993) published guidance for councils and health bodies on the development of services for adults with learning disabilities whose behaviours or mental health problems present a challenge to services. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since 1993 a great deal&amp;nbsp;has changed: the old long-stay hopsitals are nearly closed and&amp;nbsp;most people with learning disabilities - including those who present challenging behaviour - live in the community with their families, in small residential homes or in their own homes, with varying levels of support.&amp;nbsp; The idea that services should be designed around the individual is now central to government policy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report publishes key recommendations crucial to developing and sustaining quality services to meet local needs. These recommendations describe the aims of the services, the service models themselves and commissioning methods for service development.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This is a good practice guide for undertaking a comprehensive sexual health needs assessment (SHNA) at local level.&amp;nbsp; It is aimed at&amp;nbsp;those who are responsible for the planning, commissioning and delivery of sexual health services and for reducing health inequalities.&amp;nbsp;Investment in sexual health services can deliver significant healthcare savings through preventing unintended pregnancies and reducing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&amp;nbsp; PCTs are responsible for ensuring sexual health services meet local population needs and reduce health inequalities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To this end, appropriate service commissioning and service provision is inextricably linked to local sexual health needs assessments (SHNAs). The SHNA guide was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health's National Support Teams for Sexual Health and Teenage Pregnancy.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

Atlases, presented for Sheffield's 28 Wards and 7 Community Assemblies to support the Director of Public Health Annual Report 2009, can be accessed below. Atlases for other geographical areas are available via the NHS Sheffield website. The Atlases will be constantly updated as new data become available.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data are grouped under the headings of Population, Life Expectancy, Mortality, Hospital Activity, Other Health Indicators, Social Segmentation, Wider Determinants.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Atlas contains themed maps, data tables, trend tables, graphs covering all of the areas, graphs showing the quintiles of areas, details of data sources and data notes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are several options for viewing data. The user can easily move between different types of views, different geographies and different time periods. All atlases will open in a new browser window.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The purpose of this booklet is to raise awareness of the value for money that small firms can offer, to explore the issues that can make it difficult for them to win public sector business, and set out some ideas about how you can help. It is aimed at procurement professionals in the public sector.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The booklet states that opening the market to a wider supplier base means that:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;you will not miss out on potential suppliers who may be more competitive&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;you might find innovative solutions you might otherwise have missed&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;you will avoid the danger of the market stagnating through an ever decreasing number of large suppliers&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;simplifying the procurement process and removing unnecessary obstacles can help to make your life easier&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <description>This study focuses on social enterprises in primary care, with particular emphasis on ownership and accountability arrangements. National stakeholders were interviewed, drawn from professional and trades unions, the Department of Health, national policy advisors, national voluntary organisations, and national organisations with a specific interest in social enterprises. Interviews were also carried out with local stakeholders involved in five social enterprises reflecting a range of approaches, including clinician-led initiatives, PCT-wide approaches, and a healthy living centre.</description>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance focuses on different stages of the procurement process, and the way social issues can legitimately be incorporated into the purchasing cycle. The key points to remember when looking to incorporate social issues are:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- They must be relevant to the subject of the contract.&lt;BR&gt;- Actions must be consistent with the Government's procurement policy based on value for money.&lt;BR&gt;- Actions must be consistent with the EU Treaty and the EU Public Procurement Directive.&lt;BR&gt;- Actions taken on sustainable development considerations can have implications in the shorter, medium and longer term. Sustainable procurement must be approached from a whole life cost perspective.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>This practical planning guide seeks to help you to develop and deliver effective solutions to change the behaviours of people who may have the symptoms of cancer to present early at primary care.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This practical planning guide seeks to help you to develop and deliver effective solutions to change the behaviours of people who may have the symptoms of cancer to present early at primary care.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The resource draws on evolving best practice in social marketing, draws together useful information relevant to cancer and builds on the many lessons that have been learned over the past few years. It will be useful for you if you are developing or commissioning a social marketing intervention, or need to understand more about social marketing and what it can do for early diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cancer survival is low in England in relation to comparable western European countries. Much of this is due to late diagnosis – improving awareness and early diagnosis has the potential to save 10,000 lives in England each year (equating to around 66 lives per PCT, per year). The National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI) has been set up to improve early diagnosis and cancer survival, this planning guide has been developed as part of work on NAEDI.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The guide sets out six key stages to the social marketing planning process: a broad framework for you to work within as you develop an approach that suits your needs. Most social marketing interventions will move through these six stages in turn.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At each stage a number of ‘Task Areas’ are identified which describe the kinds of activities you may need to carry out. Within each Task Area, specific tasks are described in more detail, including setting out how you might carry out the task, examples of how it is being tackled elsewhere, useful information and data, and helpful tips and advice.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ The overall aim of the project was to develop an agreed model of care which describes how the ‘must have’ components of the diabetes service (see diagram below) are to be delivered in the local health community and how national specifications for diabetes services are to be met. The project was concerned with undertaking a robust needs assessment to inform the future model of care. This was also used to develop prioritised and costed recommendations for phased implementation to inform the commissioning plans of each PCT with quantification of the anticipated benefits arising from implementation of those recommendations.]]&gt;</body>

This means that a specialised service would not be provided by every hospital in England; generally, it would be provided by less than 50 hospitals.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Specialised Services National Definitions Set (SSNDS) describe these services in more detail. The definitions provide a helpful basis for service reviews and strategic planning and enable commissioners to make comparisons on activity levels and spend. The definitions assist in the identification of activity that should be regarded as specialised and therefore subject to collaborative commissioning arrangements. The 10 Specialised Commissioning Groups, acting on behalf of their member PCTs, are responsible for the commissioning arrangements for specialised services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It should be noted that the definitions are not service specifications, descriptions of best / evidence based practice or service models and should not be used as a tool to change or inform clinical practice.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Until the 1960s most patients entering NHS hospitals were cared for in 'Nightingale wards'. Since then new builds have experimented with "racetrack" wards and 4-6 bedded bays. More recently the case has been made for more single room accommodation in new hospital designs and some argue for the abolition of all shared accommodation. This Policy Plus briefing explores the evidence on the advantages and disadvantages of such a move.]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;The report is structured around health programmes for different conditions (listed below).&amp;nbsp; It suggests a series of improvements that might be made at each step in the patient journey for each programme.&amp;nbsp; The aim is to “add life to years” and not just “years to life” and in so doing meet the newly published criteria of “World Class Commissioning”.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The sections are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Infections diseases&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Cancers and tumours&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Blood disorders&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic problems&lt;/LI&gt;

    <description>Guide providing information and practical tools for PCTs and Practice Based Commissioners to help with commissioning enhanced primary eye care services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The purpose of this guide is to provide information and practical tools for PCTs and Practice Based Commissioners as they commission enhanced primary eye care services. This guide offers a practical, analytical, 'how to' approach to some of the key issues in commissioning high quality community eye care services locally. It is designed to help:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Practice Based Commissioners and PCTs take ownership of eye care commissioning priorities, mitigate commissioning risks as well as develop and evaluate alternative primary eye care services; 
&lt;LI&gt;assess, in simple terms, what the patient demand is on hospital eye care services; 
&lt;LI&gt;describe what alternatives there are to building capacity across the system to achieve the 18 week referral to treatment target; 
&lt;LI&gt;describe what investment may be needed in primary care and any potential commissioning savings; 
&lt;LI&gt;develop skills and techniques to commission more effectively, including engaging patients and the public, making eye care services more accessible for an ageing population.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

It is based on four in-depth case studies that demonstrate how commissioning has been used to develop new social enterprise markets. They aim to provide practical advice to support commissioners to establish new social enterprises and new innovative service lines. This report also includes a discussion of key issues; situations where social enterprise may be particularly appropriate and simple actions that commissioners can take to support further social enterprise development.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Literature review of ways of thinking about strategy for Primary Care Trust top teams to deliver world class commissioning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although all of the world class competencies have a strategic dimension, two are perhaps most directly focused on strategy:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Competency 1: ‘Are recognised as the local leader of the NHS’&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Competency 6: ‘Prioritise investment according to local needs, service requirements and the values of the NHS’&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This review of the published literature on strategy is intended to provide an overview of the main approaches to developing strategy, how these can be applied in practice, and how the resulting strategy can be best implemented. Eight illustrative case studies, taken from a range of different sectors outside of the NHS, demonstrate a variety of different approaches to formulating and developing strategy, and describe the outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Although all of the world class competencies have a strategic dimension, two are perhaps most directly focused on strategy:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Competency 1: ‘Are recognised as the local leader of the NHS’&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Competency 6: ‘Prioritise investment according to local needs, service requirements and the values of the NHS’&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This review of the published literature on strategy is intended to provide an overview of the main approaches to developing strategy, how these can be applied in practice, and how the resulting strategy can be best implemented. Eight illustrative case studies, taken from a range of different sectors outside of the NHS, demonstrate a variety of different approaches to formulating and developing strategy, and describe the outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This publication aims to help local commissioners in the public sector get better value for money from third sector organisations.  It also aims to help third sector organisations become more informed about the commissioning process, and about what they should expect from financial relationships with the public sector.  Where the third sector can help deliver value for money then commissioners should make the best possible use of it.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This publication aims to help local commissioners in the public sector get better value for money from third sector organisations.&amp;nbsp; It also aims to help third sector organisations become more informed about the commissioning process, and about what they should expect from financial relationships with the public sector.&amp;nbsp; Where the third sector can help deliver value for money then commissioners should make the best possible use of it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Rather than telling commissioners how to do commissioning, this guidance focuses on those aspects of the process that are most likely to affect financial relationships with third sector organisations. It looks at how commissioners can help the third sector to deliver services and outcomes that represent value for money.&amp;nbsp; The guidance aims to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;clearly set out the main issues for effective financial relationships with third sector organisations; 
&lt;LI&gt;make use of existing guidance in an accessible and practical way; 
&lt;LI&gt;dispel some of the "myths" that exist around commissioning with the third sector; and 
&lt;LI&gt;improve practices to achieve greater value for money.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

It maps out how social care commissioners and providers, together with those involved in training and education, can boost the role of social care in end of life care. Without the full engagement of social care in end of life care, the support provided for individuals and their families will not achieve its full potential.</description>

    <description>Toolkit and guidance.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Department of Health has developed a simple toolkit that can be used to determine weighted capitation indicative budgets at practice level. The data files for use in the toolkit have now been updated to include 2006 data.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The weighted capitation formulae are benchmark guide to determine 'fair resource shares' and not an automatic means to set indicative budgets. As detailed in 'Practice based commissioning: Practical Implementation', practice indicative budgets in 2007/08 should be calculated on the basis of actual activity (at 2007/08 prices), current formulae for prescribing plus uplift and weighted capitation where no historic data is available.&amp;nbsp; The guidance states that practices that are further than 10% from fair shares should make progress towards the fair share target, but pace of change measures should not be overly aggressive.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This guidance is split into two sections. The first is a guide to using the toolkit, and the second is a more general guide on how the outputs of the toolkit should be used. It should be read in conjunction with 'Practice based commissioning: Practical implementation'.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This literature review and toolkit is intended to help organisations seek out opportunities to make significant improvements to the lives of the public. The NHS is familiar with the need to make tough choices and crunch decisions resulting from finite resources and apparently infinite demand. It is widely recognised that these tough choices will become increasingly challenging in the context of the economic crisis and fiscal climate. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These challenges include investment decisions (service A OR service B? treatment A OR treatment B?). These are undeniably difficult challenges, often with no straightforward ‘correct’ answer, or even a clearly established method for tackling the problem. They involve dynamic tensions that need to be actively debated and managed by those designing, developing, delivering and receiving NHS services. Technical tools (such as modelling, generating scenarios, economic forecasting) are necessary but not sufficient for making such decisions. Almost any major health decision is heavily influenced by non-technical forces (such as local or national politics, organisational cultures, media involvement, and pressure from interest groups). &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report making recommendations to increase access to, and the uptake of, NHS dental services in London.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Evidence shows that London is relatively well served for dentists, compared to other parts of the country.&amp;nbsp;However, Londoners are less likely than others to visit an NHS dentist.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Major reforms were made in 2006 to NHS dental care, affecting the way services are funded, managed and commissioned. Dentists' dissatisfaction with these changes led to media speculation that large numbers of&amp;nbsp;dentists would quit the NHS, which would make it more difficult for patients to access NHS dental care.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Following this,&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;investigation was conducted to try and answer three key questions:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. Why is uptake of NHS dental care so low in the capital?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. What could be done to increase uptake?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3. What impact have the April 2006 reforms to dental services had on access to and uptake of NHS dental care?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report provides eight recommendations for improving access to, and uptake of, NHS dental services in London.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Online article which asks what has happened to the extra money promised for the NHS since 2000, and whether is has made the NHS into a better health service and is improving the population's health.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The traditional complaint - not least from the NHS itself - used to be that the health service was underfunded. For decades, compared with our European neighbours we spent less per head and less as a proportion of our wealth on health care. Successive governments countered this in part by replying that the NHS was a particularly efficient system and so did not need to spend as much as the French or the Germans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But all this changed in 2000 when Tony Blair committed his government to spend significantly more on the NHS; the goal was to match the average spend across the (old) European Union. And now, seven years later, public plus private health spend across the UK is nudging close to 9.3% of GDP - a rise of over 2 percentage points. Indeed, since 2000, cash spend on the UK NHS alone has more than doubled - by around £55 billion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The question now however is: what’s happened to all this money? Is the NHS a better health service? Is it carrying out more operations? And, crucially, is health improving as a result?&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;LI&gt;ensure that healthcare organisations always seek improvement and provide value for money&lt;/LI&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Referral wizard aiming to help improve service and reduce waiting times. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Big Wizard is a more comprehensive tool. It addresses the following questions:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how to begin&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;where are we now&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;what does the current service look like&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;what is our vision of a future service?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how do we get the queue in the right order?&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;how can we continue to improve?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The level of detail in each section varies from basic information and techniques (that all Primary Care Organisations ought to be undertaking) to some quite complex concepts. The complex areas are for interest only and are provided for those who want to go beyond the basics. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Your team is in the driving seat from day one, making real decisions based on realistic scenarios but in a totally risk-free environment that provides the opportunity to experiment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The focus of the Commissioning Simulator is on teamwork and interaction. Participants are organised into teams and given a role that is different from their everyday work position. Using the information provided, teams must decide on their objectives and targets, then commission accordingly. Each team has the same resources of management time and budget to commission for services in five distinct areas.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;The report looks at the reasons why gender remains such an important determinant of health status and considers the ways in which gender inequalities can be tackled within the present legislative and policy framework. It also brings together the knowledge and evidence in relation to six specific areas of health concern.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It also&amp;nbsp;makes a number of recommendations in relation to each area of health concern, with eight recommendations for health policy overall.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>This document provides a summary of the main areas of activity in relation to the NSF for renal services.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of the main areas of activity in relation to the National Service Framework for renal servces since the Department of Health published its last progress report in September 2005. It has been written for people who work in the field of kidney care and for everyone who has an interest in kidney disease.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since the last report, the Department has been working to generate best practice, improve primary care, expand capacity for haemodialysis and improve the transport available to patients for this vital service. Some positive signs are visible, in that, in many parts of the country, services are starting to change for the better.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the future improvement will be concentrated on the response to&amp;nbsp;acute renal failure, pre-dialysis preparation and the transition from children's to adult services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;New EU rules which improve access to rapid and effective review procedures for suppliers who allege that public authorities have breached procurement rules have taken effect in the UK.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The EU Remedies Directive amends the UK Public Contract Regulations and will affect all procurement contracts commenced after 20 December 2009.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The new rules aim in particular to tackle the direct illegal award of contracts and to improve the effectiveness of pre-contractual remedies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;NHS trusts that fall foul of the rules will be subject to new fines, the possibility of having contracts shortened and, where there are serious breaches of public procurement rules, having their contracts overturned.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>In the recent White Paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS, there is a commitment to providing better value from the resources available to healthcare. This requires the NHS to address variations in activity and spend. Such variations indicate the need to focus on appropriateness of care, and to investigate the possibilities that there is overuse of some interventions and that some lower value activities are undertaken. In the atlas, Right Care presents a series of 34 maps of variation selected from topics which National Clinical Directors and others have identified as being of importance to their clinical specialty.</description>

    <description>This paper provides a brief guide to the methods used for measuring what matters most to patients. The aim is to help trust boards and other interested parties decide which measurement and feedback tools are appropriate for their requirements.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Point of Care programme aims to transform the quality of patients’ experience in acute hospitals. Achieving this ambitious goal will depend on the active engagement of all staff who have direct contact with patients. They in turn will require strong support from their managers, trust boards and commissioners. All these interested parties need robust evidence on the quality of patients’ experience, and that of their families. It is now widely recognised that the best source of this information is patients and families themselves. &lt;/P&gt;

    <description>One in a series of seven papers on market facilitation.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Paper 5 in this series was about the tendering and contractual relationships where the local authority is purchasing care on behalf of individuals. This paper (sixth in series) explores the arrangements that individuals may need to make where they are purchasing care themselves, either entirely with their own resources or by using funding from the local authority under an individual budget or a direct payment. The paper divides into two parts. Section A sets out the policy and legal context of individual contracts and covers the various purchasing arrangements that may be in place. Section B looks at greater detail that individuals may need to consider in setting up any care arrangement. Appendix 1 provides an example of a local authority individual budget payment agreement.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The German health care system is a high-performing one, where recent policy reforms have attempted to contain costs and strengthen competition. With recent policy proposing the formation of a national commissioning board for England, the Nuffield Trust and colleagues were interested to learn from Germany how a statutory not-for-profit national insurer was managing to achieve better value health care in an economically challenging environment. What followed was a study visit to Techkniker Krankenkasse (TK) – one of Germany’s largest statutory health insurance companies, based in Hamburg.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This briefing paper highlights many of the issues discovered that reflect practice not just at TK, but within the wider German health care system, and sets out potential learning for the NHS in England.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This briefing paper will be of interest to policy-makers, senior practitioners, academics and students of European and UK health policy.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;In 2001, the Government published the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV. This was a major milestone: it placed sexual health and HIV firmly on the national agenda and set out an ambitious 10-year programme to tackle sexual ill-health and modernise sexual health services in England. This review assesses the impact of the Strategy to date and highlights significant developments which have taken place since publication. It outlines what has been achieved and addresses the key barriers which have impeded implementation. Most importantly, it recommends a wide-ranging set of actions required at national, regional and local level to respond to the new operating environment and drive further improvements. It also proposes a sexual health and HIV indicator set with which to measure progress.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ Prepared by Sussex HIS, this paper and complementary diagram draw on discussions which have been taking place both in Sussex and within the wider community around the need to support World Class Commissioning (WCC). The paper sets out some key concepts within Information and Knowledge Management and then offers a potential way of creating a road map from where we are to where we might want to be. It draws on discussion and output from the SEC Word Class Commissioning event in March 2008, and is primarily aimed at PCT Chief Executives and Directors of Commissioning.]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This document is aimed at those who are responsible for planning and commissioning health care within the prison service. This includes prison governors, prison health care staff and local NHS health care commissioners. In prisons demand for health care often appears to outstrip the capacity of services. The health care needs assessment approach deals with this problem by differentiating between needs and demands for health care services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;He debates the consequences of the shift away from an “NHS first” model of provision and agrees that the future of community services could be at risk because of its “Cinderella management”.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Transactions Manual is a system management tool introduced in the 2008/9 Operating Framework.

The Manual has been developed jointly with Monitor to support best practice amongst providers of NHS services, commissioners, Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and their respective advisers as they develop transactions within the UK health economy.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Transactions Manual is a system management tool introduced in the 2008/9 Operating Framework.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Manual has been developed jointly with Monitor to support best practice amongst providers of NHS services, commissioners, Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and their respective advisers as they develop transactions within the UK health economy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The transactions covered by the Manual are acquisitions, divestments or disposals, demergers, joint ventures, franchises and statutory mergers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Manual guides parties through a best practice approach to the transaction process and provides technical detail to the various areas of law, policy and practice that may be needed to complete the transaction successfully.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Manual incorporates best practice guidance, as well as mandatory practice required by law or by policy that may change from time to time.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the manual may be updated accordingly. Users should therefore check that they are using the latest version.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Manual is for use by SHAs, PCTs, NHS Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts and independent sector organisations where they are involved or considering involvement in a transaction and where one of the parties to the transaction is an NHS Trust or PCT. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Plans are underway to transfer community service provision from primary care trusts by April 2011. The presence of these services in the community and their close day-to-day working relationships with GPs means they are well placed to deliver the improvements that strike at the heart of the Government’s planned NHS reforms. This briefing sets out the key points from NHS Confederation's discussions with members who have experience of transferring services, including their learning about how best to transfer services, what exactly should be transferred, the cultural issues to consider and the necessary governance arrangements.</description>

New currencies (the units of healthcare for which a provider is funded) and better pricing are key to transforming community services, enabling commissioners to incentivise improvements in quality and value. The use of new currencies with accurate pricing should also lead to more services being available closer to home for patients.]]&gt;</body>

    <description>HSMC was commissioned by the Department of Health to undertake rapid reviews of the literature in six clinical areas to provide the evidence base for the Department’s recently published Transforming Community Service Clinical Guides. They reviewed more than 18,000 studies around the world in acute services, children’s services, end of life care, long term conditions, rehabilitation services and wellbeing and inequalities. The aim of the reviews was to identify good practice in these areas which is not already widely implemented in the NHS and to assess the nature of the available research.</description>

    <description>We know that we need to provide for increasing numbers of people with long term conditions (LTCs). These people will rightly expect services designed to enable their condition to be managed within their life, not their life managed by their condition. This guide is a practical tool to enable practitioners to work with people with LTCs. It will support them in the design and delivery of effective care which enables people to stay as well as possible for as long as possible while being in control of their own condition.</description>

    <description>This is a good practice guide on effective transition from children's to adult services for young people with complex health needs.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;More children with complex health needs now live into adult life yet health services have not always recognised the need to prepare them for the move into adult services. A&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;ll young people with health needs are at risk during transition and that those with neurological disorders and disabilities are the least well served. GPs and adult services must recognise their long-term health needs so as to deliver appropriate services. Health needs include therapeutic and practical inputs, treatment for complications and functional deterioration which may result from progressive conditions, appropriate treatment for everyday and unrelated diseases, and understanding about what young people can do to maintain their own health.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;While relevant to all health needs, this good practice guide has a particular focus for young people with disabilities which include conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and spina bifida, as well as learning difficulties (developmental coordination disorders), learning disabilities, sensory impairments, autism spectrum disorders, acquired brain injury or intractable long-term conditions/syndromes (such as some forms of epilepsy).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This guide builds on a wealth of good practice and aims to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;place the young person’s needs and aspirations at the centre of the transition process; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;reinforce the need for a clear inter-agency planning structure which is based on good communication, education and training of staff, has agreed protocols that take account of national standards and evaluates outcomes of local planning to improve experiences of transition for these young people; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;acknowledge that transition does not end when the young person moves on from child-centred services but continues in adult services; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;highlight practical approaches through which both the children's and adult health services can contribute to improving the transition process for&amp;nbsp;young people with complex needs (including mental health, long-term conditions and palliative care) and disabilities (both those with and without statements of special educational needs (SEN)); and 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Syntax-Roman&gt;support the commissioning process by clarifying the driving principles of person-centred planning and partnership working, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the professionals/main agencies involved in the transition process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Patient experience ‘First Steps’ diagnostic tool and tool for measuring ‘Public confidence in local NHS’.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The Department of Health has developed a number of toolkits to help NHS organisations better understand and interpret their patient experience data.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Patient experience ‘First Steps’ diagnostic tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The overall aim of this tool is to help organisations identify areas where they can improve the experience of patients. This in turn will help improve their patient experience PSA scores (PSA delivery agreement 19, Indicator 1: Ensure Better care for all) and ‘Vital signs’ scores (VSB15 – Self-reported experience of patients and users). The data are also used for the first five indicators (out of eight) for the User experience dimension of the Performance Framework.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The diagnostic tool is intended for use by performance/information analysts at NHS organisations and other healthcare personnel who have an interest in improving the experience of their patients.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tool uses the latest scored data from the national patient surveys across five healthcare settings: adult inpatients 2008/09, A&amp;amp;amp;E services 2008/09, primary care services 2007/08, community mental health services 2007/08 and outpatients 2004/05.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool for measuring ‘Public confidence in local NHS’&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A national indicator has been defined as part of ‘Vital Signs’ (VSB16) to help to embed the concepts of ‘Public confidence in local NHS’. It captures an idea that is vital to the way patients and the public perceive their local health services, and is measured using local mechanisms and focussing on local priorities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This indicator is a composite one, made up of three domains, applying to acute trusts only. The domains that make up this indicator are also used for the final three indicators (out of eight) for the User experience dimension of the Performance Framework.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This tool is designed to allow you to explore how the scores for your organisation are constructed, and identify areas for improvement that can positively influence future results.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This programme focuses on the workforce planning implications of commissioning health and/or social care services for a local health economy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The programme has been developed to assist service commissioners, workforce planners and other managers who have responsibility for commissioning, planning, providing, managing or supporting the delivery of health and social care services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Registration is required, however this is free. There is around an hour and a half of learning material on the disc broken into bite sized lessons. The user can work through the guide at their own pace as an educational resource or refer to it as a best practice guide when they are developing plans in the future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The six modules are:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 1 – Health needs assessment (HNA)&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 2 – Reviewing service provision&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 3 – Deciding priorities&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 4 – Designing services&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 5 – Shaping the structure of supply&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Module 6 – Managing demand&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The CHPP is a tool for supporting commissioners to meet obligations on breast feeding, obesity prevention, infant mortality and the 12-week antenatal assessment. This programme will help meet these requirements, but also help to improve general health and well being among children and families in the community. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. As part of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreement, which became effective on 1 January 2009, the Department of Health (DH) and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) agreed to publish information on variation in the use in the NHS of selected medicines recommended by NICE.</description>

&lt;P&gt;The NHS Information Centre was asked to produce a bulletin looking at the variation in use of these medicines in relation to the expected number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. Data on the number of patients being treated is not available and so predicted use (using the expected number of eligible patients, the average dose and average length of treatment) was compared with observed use. Data on observed use in 2008 was taken from the primary care prescribing data (ePACT), and secondary care data (Hospital Pharmacy Audit Index). Data from the Prescribing Cost Analysis database was also used to look at long term trends in terms of cost.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Prior to the introduction of the 2006 NHS dental contract in England and Wales, general dental practitioners (GDPs) were responsible for the provision of out-of-hours (OOH) emergency dental services (EDS); however there was great national variation in service provision. Under the contractual arrangements introduced 1st April 2006, local commissioning agencies became formally responsible for the provision of out-of-hours emergency dental services. This study aimed to examine patients' use of an out-of-hours emergency dental service and to determine whether the introduction of the 2006 national NHS dental contract had resulted in a change in service use, with a view to informing future planning and commissioning of care.</description>

&lt;P&gt;The study has provided an insight into how and why people use an out-of-hours emergency dental service and has helped to guide future commissioning of these services. Overall, the service was being used in much the same way both before and after the 2006 dental contract. Significantly more use was being made of NHS Direct after April 2006; however, informal information networks such as friends and family remain an important source of information about accessing emergency dental services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This document introduces the CQUIN payment framework in context.&amp;nbsp; It describes the framework, setting out the timetable and scope, before explaining the content that local schemes should cover, how the framework is funded, an outline of how the process for using the framework might work, and the support and assurance for local schemes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For 2010/11, this guidance is supplemented by an &lt;A href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_110431.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;addendum&lt;/A&gt;, and should be read in the context of the NHS Operating Framework for 2010/11 and the national standard contracts for acute, ambulance, community, mental health and learning disability services.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;These are value for money (VfM) profiles for PCTs, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and councils. They are more user-friendly, have a clearer focus on VfM, track levels of spend to assess the impact of improvements, and compare spend and performance to other bodies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tools are a ‘can opener’ for highlighting areas where costs and or performance look out of line and can help local services identify where there may be potential for savings. They also contain useful background and context information to help you to understand VfM issues for each service area.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Decisions about which conditions and treatments to prioritise are never easy. Paul Dolan and colleagues argue that they should be based on people’s experiences rather than on what people think they might feel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Valuing the relative benefits of different treatments helps to allocate scarce healthcare resources to where they do the most good. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) advises on the cost effectiveness of treatments and recommends that health benefits should be valued in terms of gains in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). This approach assigns a value between 0 (for death) and 1 (for full health) to each health state and then multiplies that value by how long the state lasts. It makes good sense to value health benefits by accounting for duration in this way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The authors, however, have serious concerns about NICE’s recommendations for the "quality adjustment" part of the QALY. NICE suggests asking members of the general public to think about how many years of life they would be willing to trade to avoid different states of health. The authors feel that these hypothetical preferences often bear little relation to the real experiences of those in the health states. This article offers an alternative means of valuation that could help direct resources to treatments in proportion to the real suffering they alleviate.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) is a process that helps decision-makers maximise the impact of healthcare resources on the health needs of a local population.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Programme budgeting is an appraisal of past resource allocation in specified programmes, with a view to tracking future resource allocation in those same programmes.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Marginal analysis is the appraisal of the added benefits and added costs of a proposed investment (or the lost benefits and lower costs of a proposed disinvestment).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <description>The financial risk associated with a fixed budget for the purchase of health care on behalf of a defined population (members of an insurance scheme, GP list, managed care organisation, etc) is a poorly understood area. The issues surrounding such risk fall under three broad categories, namely, the contribution of simple randomness and that of the weather and wider environment to higher volatility in costs; factors which contribute to financial asymmetry, i.e. why some experience higher cost pressures than others arising from the funding formula and local acute costs arising from the HRG tariff and finally from the trajectory of general healthcare costs relative to funding. The essential question, to which there is not a definitive answer, is whether GPs can reduce costs to a sufficient degree to ensure a long-term profit in the face of high inherent uncertainty and volatility in both present and future costs.</description>

    <description>This paper looks at the challenges involved in ensuring that the design of the emerging market is appropriate and in reconciling the logic of a system driven by competition but overseen by politicians.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;The implication of the post election reappraisal is that provider competition will become an even more important driver of reform in future, and national targets and performance management will become less significant.&amp;nbsp;Competition will be stimulated by the policy of extending the range of choices available to patients and by introducing greater plurality among providers, using Payment by Results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The theory behind the reforms is that empowering patients and encouraging new providers into the market will create a dynamic for improvement from within the NHS, thereby enabling politicians to be less involved in micro managing change. The challenge in implementing this theory is to ensure that the design of the emerging market is appropriate and to reconcile the logic of a system driven by competition. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reforms to the NHS are using patient choice and provider competition to drive improvements in performance. In completing the design of the reforms, the government faces the challenge of ensuring that commissioners can negotiate on equal terms with providers and that appropriate arrangements are put in place for market management and regulation. Politicians also face the challenge of dealing with NHS providers that go into difficulty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper examines these issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT face=AkzidenzGroteskBE-Regular size=1&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=AkzidenzGroteskBE-Md size=1&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT face=AkzidenzGroteskBE-Md color=#ffffff size=1&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Published in June 2008, this report focuses on local accountability and public involvement in the planning, purchasing and delivery of healthcare in England. It defines accountability and differentiates it from public involvement, and it considers how these concepts operate now - and could operate in future - across the domains of health service commissioning, healthcare provision and public health. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The evidence taken by the LGA Health Commission strongly suggests that there is currently no appetite for further major upheaval in the governance, structures or boundaries of the healthcare system. However it was also clear that local accountability for local decision-making was weak.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Health Commission has sought practical recommendations that build on existing reforms and are designed to strengthen the mechanisms of local accountability, while recognising that for the foreseeable future there will be both a national and a local dimension to the governance. &lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This report is a detailed plan of action on engagement across the NHS. The reports five main recommendations are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. More shared decisions in the consulting room – greater support for initiatives that allow patients to take more control if they want it. Shared decision making and people focused skills need to be a stronger theme in professional training and regulation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. GP surgeries to be more responsive to their local populations – closer engagement between GP practices and their patients, communities and LINks, supported by more sensitive regulation and monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3. More responsive and accountable commissioning. Commissioning, whether through primary care trusts (PCTs) or practice based commissioning (PBC) clusters, will be more effective if it involves patients and communities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;4. A stronger push at national level to share power with patients and citizens, government, regulators and professions do more to promote shared decision making for individual patients, including more community participation in the NHS, and a more listening and responsive service.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5. Explore co-production of services – this could offer a new vision of how primary care could design, deliver and monitor improved health care, in collaboration with the population it serves, through users groups, LINks and the voluntary sector.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This article summarises the Healthy Accountability Forum which took place in March 2009.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Recent NHS policy has emphasised ‘commissioning’ as a key strategic driver of health improvement for local communities. The commissioning process determines the way in which resources are allocated but also shapes the way care services are provided. So while there will always be a role for scrutiny committees to ensure quality of provision, there are significant further opportunities for scrutiny throughout all phases of the ‘commissioning cycle’ – strategic planning, procurement, as well as monitoring and evaluation.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Report of the conference, held on 31 October 2007.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;On 31 October 2007, the NHS Working in Partnership Programme (WiPP) hosted a national conference on self care, with a focus on investing in self care. It brought together health professionals, practitioners and policy makers for a day of discussion and debate, built around the seven ages of health: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, working life, retirement and end of life - theming which aimed to illustrate that self care is about the whole of life, rather than just managing long term conditions or the end of life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;The conference marked the launch of the NHS Working in Partnership Programme’s online self care resource and networking organisation, &lt;A href="http://www.selfcareconnect.nhs.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Self Care Connect&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Frutiger-Light&gt;The conference also raised the following points:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;today’s sedentary lifestyles will cost the NHS billions of pounds in the future, so people must be supported in making healthier lifestyle choices;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;self care leads to reduced utilisation of health services in both primary and secondary care, more appropriate use of medicines, and shorter and less acute episodes of chronic conditions;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;self care services can be commissioned at all stages of life. Seven initiatives and services were explored by delegates in a series of workshops themed around the seven ages of man.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;At the end of the day, 100% of delegates said they believed self care support services were worth investing in, compared with 83% at the start of the day.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This practical guide describes a process for planning change with people which provides powerful insights into what is working and not working in their lives as well as their aspirations for the future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Working together for change can be used to ensure that active partnerships with local people and families are the driving force behind social care transformation programmes, as a vehicle for ensuring effective community engagement in the joint strategic needs assessment (JSNA) and as a tool for strategic commissioning and service development.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is compatible with work conducted by the DH to design an outcomes-focused review process for self-directed support that works for people and provides valuable performance information for councils so that the outcomes for people and communities can be understood - i.e. it this information in aggregate form that drives the process described in working together for change.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;World Class Commissioning sets out an aspiration for primary care trusts (PCTs) and for the central role of commissioning within the NHS. Whilst establishing tough standards and high expectations for PCTs, the world-class commissioning vision explicitly recognises the challenge facing the NHS in pioneering much of the approach itself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this paper is to consider how PCTs need to respond in the immediate future.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;Videos and resources from the virtual conference for world class commissioning assurance - launch of Year 2.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nearly 400 SHA and PCT CEOs, chairs, PEC chairs and key partners gathered in London on 16 September to hear about the refined assurance framework for Year 2.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Gary Belfield, acting director general of Commissioning &amp;amp; System Management (DH), chaired the day, supported by a video message from David Nicholson, NHS chief executive. An expert panel took questions from the floor and two PCT CEOs discussed the impact of WCC on PCT commissioning.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Interactive seminar sessions included: strengthening community partnerships, working effectively with providers to stimulate the market and robust analysis of spend and its impact on health benefit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Attendees each received a copy of the WCC assurance handbook for Year 2. This is a guide for PCTs and SHAs that explains WCC assurance in detail. In the same way as last year, PCTs can access the handbook and accompanying soft copy documentation on the WCC toolkit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;NHS commissioning teams and other interested parties are invited to watch this event online. You can:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Watch the keynotes, panel discussion and interactive workshop sessions&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Download presentations, podcasts and associated documentation, vital for your role&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Gather practical support to develop your strategic commissioning skills and capabilities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;This online resource brings together data from multiple sources to provide a profile of your organisation and national averages to help monitor trends and make comparisons. With the ability to manipulate data for local requirements and benchmarking for national, regional and most comparable PCT activity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Covering some 250 indicators, the 2009/10 data packs are designed to help PCTs prepare for the second round of the WCC panel assessments in early 2010. The data is regularly refreshed therefore providing an essential resource for commissioners throughout the entire commissioning cycle.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description>Online toolkit including the guidance, tools and templates required to support commissioning assurance and the creation of PCT plans.</description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P dir=ltr&gt;This web-based toolkit contains resources to support 'commissioning assurance'.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;'Commissioning assurance' is the system for world class commissioning. It will stand within the established annual cycle as a consistent assurance system to review Primary Care Trust (PCT) progress towards world class performance and achievement of better health outcomes. It will be delivered and managed by Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and will provide a common basis for agreeing further development. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;This toolkit includes the guidance, tools and templates required to support commissioning assurance and the creation of PCT plans. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;The 'Commissioning assurance' section&amp;nbsp;includes the guidance, tools and templates to support PCTs and SHAs to perform the assessment. It is split into four sections:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL dir=ltr&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;handbook, which provides guidance on the content and process of commissioning assurance;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;PCT preparation, which contains the templates for PCTs to complete the five steps they need to perform before the panel day;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;panel preparation, which provides guidance and automated reports both to support the creation of panel briefings and to upload them;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;output and follow-up, where panel reports&amp;nbsp;may be accessed and where ratings will be published.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;The 'PCT plans' section&amp;nbsp;includes guidance and templates to support the creation of PCT strategic plans, assisting with the development of both the long term financial plan and the organisation development plan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;PCTs and SHAs will have access to additional, password-protected&amp;nbsp;areas of the web site.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Although many trials have demonstrated statistically significant differences between groups in terms of weight loss in favour of orlistat versus placebo, the differences may not always be of clinical significance. The clinical significance of between-group differences for secondary outcomes may also be debatable. Possible adverse effects should be taken into account when prescribing orlistat, particularly gastrointestinal effects.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The prevalence of obesity in developed societies is increasing. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of co-morbidity, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Following the withdrawal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, interest has focused on a novel anti-obesity drug orlistat.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Nineteen electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2000. Additionally, Internet searches were carried out, bibliographies of retrieved articles were examined and submissions were received from the manufacturer of orlistat. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of orlistat used for weight loss or maintenance of weight loss in overweight or obese patients were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were changes in body weight, fat content or fat distribution. Secondary outcomes were changes in obesity-related risk-factor profiles, such as lipid levels, indicators of glycaemic control and blood pressure. Studies recruiting people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were excluded. Assessment of titles and abstracts was performed independently by two reviewers. If either reviewer considered a reference to be relevant, the full paper was retrieved. Full papers were assessed against the review selection criteria by two independent reviewers, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into structured summary tables and checked by a second reviewer. Any disagreements about data were resolved by discussion. Each included trial was assessed against a comprehensive checklist for methodological quality. Quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers with disagreements resolved by discussion.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The results of the review suggest that CE MRA has a better overall diagnostic accuracy than CTA or DUS, and that CE MRA is generally preferred by patients over CA. Where available, CE MRA may be a viable alternative to CA. The only controlled trial of the effectiveness of imaging procedures suggested that the results of DUS were comparable to those of CA, in terms of surgical planning and outcome. This finding conflicts with the results of diagnostic accuracy studies, which reported poor estimates of accuracy for DUS in comparison with CA. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate the usefulness of CTA for the assessment of PAD, particularly newer techniques. The results of the economic modelling suggest that for PAD patients for whom the whole leg is evaluated by a preoperative diagnostic test DUS dominates the other alternatives by presenting higher effectiveness at a lower cost per QALY. However, when the analysis of stenosis is limited to a section of the leg, either above the knee or below the knee, 2D TOF MRA appears to be the most cost-effective preoperative diagnostic strategy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterised by atheromatous narrowing or occlusion of one or more of the arteries of the leg. Symptoms include intermittent claudication (pain on walking), ischaemic rest pain, ulceration and gangrene. This review concerns the assessment of symptomatic PAD. Intervention decisions utilise information regarding the degree, length and location of stenoses or occlusions. This review summarises the evidence on the role of duplex ultrasound (DUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA), as alternatives to contrast angiography (CA), for the assessment of PAD.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Studies were identified through extensive searches of electronic databases (carried out in April 2004, with update searches in May 2005), handsearching of journals, scanning reference lists of included papers and consultation with experts in the field. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Full papers of potentially relevant studies were assessed for inclusion by one reviewer and checked by a second. Published and unpublished studies in any language were eligible for inclusion. Separate inclusion criteria, relating to study design, participant characteristics and outcome measures, were derived for each objective. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed using standardised forms. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using published checklists and criteria. All data extraction was checked by a second reviewers. Results were analysed according to test type (MRA, DUS, CTA) and diagnostic threshold (e.g. 50% stenosis, occlusion). Data for different MRA techniques [e.g. time-of-flight (TOF), phase-contrast (PC), contrast-enhanced (CE)] were grouped separately. Data were further grouped according to the area of the leg assessed (whole leg, above knee, below knee, foot). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated for each data set. Individual study results were presented graphically in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. Heterogeneity was investigated using the &lt;I&gt;Q&lt;/I&gt; statistic and through visual examination of study results. Pooled estimates of diagnostic test performance were calculated where statistically and clinically meaningful; otherwise, median likelihood ratios and ranges were presented. Insufficient data were available to facilitate the use of subgroup or regression analyses to investigate potential sources of between study heterogeneity (e.g. aspects of methodological quality, presence of co-morbidities or risk factors, image postprocessing techniques, personnel involved in test interpretation).&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The study has demonstrated a number of problems stemming from the current configuration of vascular services, which are leading to excess mortality and morbidity, including limb loss and stroke. There is a need to rationalise services, taking into account the demonstrated clinical benefits of sub-specialisation and patient preferences for local services. The compromise of ‘hub and spoke’ arrangements, with a variable range of facilities being provided locally through a service linked to a major centre would seem likely to best achieve this compromise for centres without sufficient workload to provide a full range of local services. Such an arrangement would also be relatively straightforward to achieve through a staged reconfiguration of services.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Increasing sub-specialisation has produced considerable organisational problems in many specialities. Over the past 20 years general surgery has gradually developed a number of sub-specialities, with some of these already being recognised as separate entities with their own training and accreditation. Urology became a separate speciality some years ago and other components of general surgery are moving in the same direction. Vascular surgery is a relatively new speciality. In the UK the Vascular Surgical Society was formed in 1966 with 26 members and has expanded to a membership of 626 in 1998. Recent developments&lt;BR&gt;in both surgical and radiological techniques have led to a rapid growth in the sub-specialities of both vascular surgery and vascular radiology. This process has led to considerable organisational problems in the provision of vascular servicesin many countries. Vascular surgery presents particular problems in that much of the workload is complex and urgent, it may require technology that is specialised and expensive and frequently requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Activity data related to users of vascular services in North Trent. For conjoint analysis, an outpatient sample of patients with moderate or mild peripheral vascular disease in a teaching and a district general hospital in North Trent was used. For the standard gamble exercise a sample of the general population was identified in four districts within North Trent. All vascular surgical and interventional radiological procedures carried out for patients with vascular disease were considered in the workload analysis and modelling exercise. A number of options for the organisation of services were considered including devolved, fully centralised and ‘hub and spoke’ arrangements. Utility analysis used a ‘no props’ variant of the standard gamble technique. Conjoint analysis was through a self-completed postal questionnaire.&lt;/P&gt;

    <title>Exercise Evaluation Randomised Trial (EXERT): a randomised trial comparing GP referral for leisure centre-based exercise, community-based walking and advice only</title>

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The results of this trial suggest that referral for tailored advice, supported by written materials, including details of locally available facilities, supplemented by detailed assessments may be effective in increasing physical activity. The inclusion of a 10-week programme of supervised exercise classes or walks as a formal component of the scheme may not be more effective than the provision of information about their availability. On cost-effectiveness grounds, assessment and advice alone from an exercise specialist may be appropriate to initiate action in the first instance. Subsidised schemes may be best concentrated on patients at higher absolute risk, or with specific conditions for which particular programmes may be beneficial. Walking appears to be as effective as leisure centre classes and is cheaper. Efforts should be directed towards maintenance of increased activity, with proven measures such as telephone support.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Physical activity is known to be beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but there is a high prevalence of inactivity in the UK population. Primary care is an important setting for encouraging increased physical activity, but brief advice from GPs may not be effective in increasing physical activity levels. Exercise referral schemes, also known as exercise on prescription, have been developed to address this issue and are increasingly popular, but have not been rigorously evaluated.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The study was a single-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, consisting of three arms, with the primary comparison at 6 months. The two structured exercise groups were followed for a further 6 months. Subjects in the control arm were rerandomised to one of the other trial arms and followed for a further year, although these data are not included in this report. Assessments were carried out at Copthall Leisure Centre in Barnet, an outer London borough, and exercise programmes conducted there and at three other leisure centres and a variety of locations suitable for supervised walking throughout the borough. Participants were aged between 40 and 74 years, not currently physically active and with at least one of the following cardiovascular risk factors: raised cholesterol, controlled moderate to mild hypertension, obesity, current smoking, diabetes and/or a family history of myocardial infarction at an early age. Of 1105 referrals received at the leisure centre over a 3-year period, 943 patients agreed to participate in the trial. They were assessed in cohorts and randomised to one of the following three arms: a 10-week programme of supervised exercise classes, two to three times a week in a local leisure centre; a 10-week instructor-led walking programme, two to three times a week; an advice-only control group who received tailored advice and information on physical activity including information on local exercise facilities. After 6 months the control group were rerandomised to one of the other trial arms. Assessments took place before randomisation, at 10 weeks (in a random 50% subsample of participants), 6 months and 1 year in the leisure centre and walking arms. The control participants were similarly assessed up to 6 months and then reassessed at the same intervals as those initially randomised to the leisure centre and walking groups. The primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported exercise behaviour, blood pressure, total cholesterol and lipid subfractions. Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry (waist-hip ratio, body mass index and percentage body fat), cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility, strength and power, self-reported lifestyle behaviour, general and psychological health status, quality of life and health service usage. The costs of providing and making use of the service were quantified for economic evaluation.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom-line conclusion:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In both reviews data for the f-EVAR studies and OSR studies were pooled and compared. Results from the reviews suggested that for JRA patients f-EVAR was favourable compared with open surgery in terms of short-term mortality and duration of operation and hospital stay, but involved a higher rate of early secondary re-intervention. However, due to the lack of reliability of the primary studies and the methods employed in the reviews to analyse the findings of these studies, the results should be interpreted with caution. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

The goal of this guideline&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;is to improve the health outcomes and quality of life for all&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;patients with thoracic aortic disease.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <title>Measurement of the clinical and cost effectiveness of non invasive diagnostic testing strategies for deep vein thrombosis</title>

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Diagnostic algorithms based on a combination of Wells score, D-dimer and ultrasound (with repeat if negative) are feasible at most UK hospitals and are among the most cost-effective. Use of repeat scanning depends on the threshold for willingness to pay for health gain. Further diagnostic testing for patients with a low Wells score and negative D-dimer is unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of resources.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A wide range of diagnostic tests may be useful in diagnosing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including clinical assessment, D-dimer, plethysmography, rheography, ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and venography. These may be used in isolation or combined as an algorithm.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Diagnostic test data and diagnostic algorithms were sought from electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, Health Technology Assessment database, BIOSIS and the ACP Journal Club, 1966–2004. Additional diagnostic test data were sought from the bibliographies of articles included in the review and contact with manufacturers of assays and instruments. A postal survey of hospitals in the UK was undertaken to describe current practice and availability of tests, and identify additional diagnostic algorithms. Diagnostic cohort studies published in English, French, Spanish or Italian that compared a non-invasive diagnostic test for DVT to an acceptable reference standard were included in the review. Details of study setting, recruitment, exclusions, population characteristics, reference standard, operator and results were extracted. Quality was judged against validated criteria. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were obtained for each test using random effects meta-analysis (MetaDISC software). The effect of study-level covariates was explored using random effects metaregression. A decision-analytic model was used to combine estimates from the metaanalysis and estimate the diagnostic performance of each algorithm in a theoretical population of outpatients with suspected DVT. The net benefit of using each algorithm was estimated from a health service perspective, using cost–utility analysis, assuming thresholds of willingness to pay of £20,000 and £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The model was analysed probabilistically and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to reflect uncertainty in estimated cost-effectiveness.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;:The findings of our study suggest that in patients with SLI due to infrainguinal disease the decision whether to perform bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty first appears to depend upon anticipated life expectancy. Patients expected to live less than 2 years should usually be offered balloon angioplasty first as it is associated with less morbidity and cost, and such patients are unlikely to enjoy the longer-term benefits of surgery. By contrast, those patients expected to live beyond 2 years should usually be offered bypass surgery first, especially where a vein is available as a conduit. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;:In most developed countries the incidence of severe limb ischaemia (SLI), characterised by the presence of rest/night pain and tissue loss (ulceration, gangrene), is estimated to be 50–100/100,000 per year and leads to significant morbidity and mortality as well as to the consumption of considerable health-care and social-care resources&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;FONT lang=JA size=2 face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT lang=JA size=2 face="Times New Roman"&gt;Recruitment began in August 1999 and finished in June 2004.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT lang=JA size=1 face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT lang=JA size=1 face="Times New Roman"&gt;39 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT lang=JA size=2 face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;FONT lang=JA size=2 face="Times New Roman"&gt;During this time, 452 patients were randomised at 27 UK hospitals. For 4 years participating centres were supported by six dedicated trial nurses who followed up patients for the first year post randomisation. Data were collated centrally and confidentially at the trial office, which was based at the University Department of Vascular Surgery, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: There is no difference between alternating pressure mattress replacements and overlays in terms of the proportion of patients developing new pressure ulcers; however, alternating pressure mattress replacements are more likely to be cost-saving.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The primary objective of the PRESSURE (Pressure RElieving Support SUrfaces: a Randomised Evaluation) Trial was to determine whether there are differences between alternating pressure overlays and alternating pressure replacement mattresses with respect to the development of new pressure ulcers, healing of existing pressure ulcers, patient acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the different pressure-relieving surfaces. The secondary objective was to investigate the specific additional impact of pressure ulcers on patients’ well-being.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, fixed sample, parallel-group trial with equal randomisation was undertaken. The trial used remote, concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. The main trial design was supplemented with a qualitative study involving a purposive sample of 20–30 patients who developed pressure ulcers, to assess the impact of the pressure ulcers on their well-being. In addition, a focus group interview was carried out with clinical research nurses, who participated in the PRESSURE Trial, to explore the experiences of their role and observations of pressure area care. The study took place in 11 hospital-based research centres within six NHS trusts in the UK. Acute and elective patients aged 55 years or older and admitted to vascular, orthopaedic, medical or care of the elderly wards in the previous 24 hours were investigated. Additional inclusion criteria were: (1) acute and elective patients with activity limitation/existing pressure ulcer on admission, who had an expected length of stay of 7 or more days; were bedfast or chairfast and completely immobile or had very limited mobility and/or had a pre-existing grade 2 pressure ulcer on admission; and gave their written informed consent to participate (or in unconscious or confused patients, the next of kin gave informed written relative assent); and (2) elective surgical patients with no activity limitation/existing pressure ulcer on admission, who were undergoing a surgical procedure with an average length of hospital stay of 7 or more days and/or expected to be bedfast or chairfast and immobile or to have very limited mobility for at least 3 days postoperatively; and gave their written informed consent to participate. Patients were excluded from the study where they had participated in this trial during a previous admission; had a pre-existing grade 3, 4 or 5 pressure ulcer on admission; were an elective surgical patient with a planned postoperative admission to the intensive care unit; were an elective surgical patient admitted more than 4 days before surgery; slept at night in a chair; or weighed over 140 kg (upper weight limit for overlay mattress) or less than 45 kg (lower weight limit for replacement mattresses with automatic sensor mats). Patients were randomised to either an alternating pressure overlay or an alternating pressure mattress replacement, with mattress specifications clearly defined to enable the inclusion of centres using products from different manufacturers, and to exclude hybrid mattress systems (which either combine foam or constant low pressure with alternating pressure in one mattress, or can be used as either an overlay or a replacement mattress). The primary end-point for the PRESSURE Trial was defined as the development of a new pressure ulcer (grade =2, i.e. partial-thickness wound involving epidermis/dermis only) on any skin site. Secondary end-points were healing of existing pressures ulcers, patient acceptability and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Standard surgical treatment of varicose veins by saphenofemoral ligation, stripping and multiple phlebectomies is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for varicose veins, with an ICER well below the threshold normally considered appropriate for the funding of treatments within the NHS. Injection sclerotherapy also appears to be cost-effective, but produces less overall benefit, with a higher ICER than surgery for patients with superficial venous reflux. In minor varicose veins without reflux, sclerotherapy is likely to provide a small average benefit with acceptable cost-effectiveness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The objective of this study was to establish the cost-effectiveness of surgery and sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were carried out for conservative treatment, sclerotherapy and surgery for varicose veins, supplemented by observational data collection in those patients who had exclusion criteria or declined participation in the RCTs. An economic analysis was carried out alongside the randomised trial. Economic modelling was undertaken based on the primary data collection and a literature review (database searches undertaken in April 2000 and updated in March 2001). Primary data collection was from two centres, recruiting from sequential referrals of patients with varicose veins to vascular surgeons at a large district general hospital in Exeter and a teaching hospital in Sheffield over a 2-year period from January 1999. Cost-effectiveness analysis and economic modelling were carried out using an NHS perspective. A total of 1009 patients were recruited, with 34 being randomised in Group 1 (minor varicose veins with no reflux, randomised between conservative treatment and sclerotherapy), 77 in Group 2 (moderate varicose veins with reflux, randomised between surgery and sclerotherapy) and 246 in Group 3 (severe varicose veins with reflux, randomised between conservative treatment and surgery). The remaining 652 patients formed the observational part of the study.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Thrombophilia is associated with increased risks of VTE in women taking oral oestrogen preparations and patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery, and VTE and adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnancy. There is considerable difference in the magnitude of the risks among different patient groups with different thrombophilic defects. In women who are on combined oral contraceptives, the ORs of VTE among those who are carriers of the FVL mutation was 15.62. However, in view of the prevalence of thrombophilia and the low prevalence of VTE in non-users of combined oral contraceptives, the absolute risk remains low. Significant risks for VTE and adverse pregnancy outcomes have been established with individual thrombophilic defects. Thrombophilic defects including FVL, high plasma factor VIIIc levels and prothrombin G20210A are associated with the occurrence of postoperative VTE in elective hip or knee replacement therapy. These associations are observed in patients who were given preoperative thromboprophylaxis and are, therefore, of clinical significance. Universal thrombophilia screening in women prior to prescribing oral oestrogen preparations, in women during pregnancy and in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery is not supported by the evidence. The findings from this study show that selective screening based on prior VTE history is more cost-effective than universal screening.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Thrombophilia is a recognised risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the optimal management is unclear in terms of the need for and effectiveness of antithrombotic interventions, especially in high-risk patient groups, including the use of oral oestrogen preparations, pregnancy and major orthopaedic surgery. Clinicians have come under pressure to initiate thrombophilia testing on an increasing number of patients and thrombophilia screening in selected patient groups has been suggested.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to establish the risk of clinical complications associated with thrombophilia in women who use oral oestrogen therapy, women who are pregnant and patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. All major electronic databases were searched by two independent reviewers: MEDLINE 1966 to June 2003, BIDS (EMBASE) 1980 to June 2003, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature print index (CINAHL) 1982 to June 2003, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1998 to June 2003, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) 1995 to June 2003 and Kings Fund, UK (last accessed June 2003). Relevant keywords related to thrombophilia, oral oestrogen, pregnancy and orthopaedic surgery were used to capture all potentially relevant studies. Only articles published in English were retrieved. This strategy was supplemented by using the Web of Science database to generate a list of articles that cited identified original studies. Handsearching of the abstracts of recent thrombosis conferences and the references of all studies meeting the reference criteria was also carried out.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Sixty-five per cent of intervention studies and 82% of determinant studies were undertaken in the USA or Canada. Both these countries differ from the UK in the recommended ages and intervals forscreening and in the organisation of screening programmes. While some of these factors may limit the generalisability of findings to the UK setting, they still provide a useful insight into screening behaviour.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Screening has been defined as "the systematic application of a test or inquiry, to identify individuals at sufficient risk of a specific disorder to warrant further investigation or direct preventive action, among persons who have not sought medical attention on account of symptoms of that disorder". Screening can be carried out with the aim of primary prevention (e.g. screening for risk factors such as hypertension), secondary prevention (e.g. cancer screening) or tertiary prevention (e.g. screening for sensorineural deafness).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Twenty-three databases of both published and grey literature were searched using strategies designed specifically for each database. Additional references were located through searching the bibliographies of related papers and contacting specialists in the subject area of the review. All published and unpublished studies were assessed for inclusion and there were no language restrictions&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Orlistat, sibutramine and metformin appear beneficial for the treatment of adults with obesity. Exercise and/or behaviour therapy appear to improve weight loss when added to diet. Low-fat diets with exercise, with or without behaviour therapy, are associated with the prevention of type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes and hypertension. Long-term weight loss in epidemiological studies was also associated with reduced risk of developing diabetes, and may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Low-fat diet and exercise interventions in individuals at risk of obesity-related illness, such as diabetes, are of comparable cost to drug treatments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Obesity is increasing in adults in the UK. In 1980 6% of men and 8% of women in England were obese, by 2000 these figures were 21% for both men and women. Obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer and osteoarthritis. In 1998 the UK National Audit Office estimated that obesity cost the NHS in England £480 million. This is a systematic review of the long-term effects of obesity treatments, not only on body weight, but also on risk factors for disease, and most importantly health.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: For the systematic review of obesity treatments in adults, the methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were adopted, in which randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least 1&amp;nbsp;year were evaluated. For the systematic epidemiological review, studies were sought on long-term (at least 2&amp;nbsp;years, or 5&amp;nbsp;years for surgery) effects of weight loss on morbidity and/or mortality, and examined through epidemiological modelling. The systematic economic review sought reports with both costs and outcomes of treatment. Recent reports assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. A Markov model was adopted to examine the cost-effectiveness of a low-fat diet and exercise intervention in adults with obesity and impaired glucose tolerance.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Foam alternatives to the standard hospital foam mattress can reduce the incidence of pressure sores in people at risk, as can pressure-relieving overlays on the operating table. One study suggests that air-fluidised therapy may increase pressure sore healing rates. 
&lt;LI&gt;Compression is more effective in healing venous leg ulcers than is no compression, and multi--layered high compression is more effective than single-layer compression. High-compression hosiery was more effective than moderate compression in preventing ulcer recurrence. 
&lt;LI&gt;There is generally insufficient reliable evidence to draw conclusions about the contribution of laser therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, electro-therapy and electromagnetic therapy to chronic wound healing. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure sores are common in both acute and community healthcare settings. The prevention and treatment of these wounds involves many strategies: pressure-relieving beds, mattresses and cushions are universally used as measures for the prevention and treatment of pressure sores; compression therapy in a variety of forms is widely used for venous leg ulcer prevention and treatment; and a whole range of therapies involving laser, ultrasound and electricity is also applied to chronic wounds. This report covers the final three reviews from a series of seven.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Nineteen electronic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), were searched. Relevant journals, conference proceedings and bibliographies of retrieved papers were handsearched. An expert panel was also consulted. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated these interventions were eligible for inclusion in this review if they used objective measures of outcome such as wound incidence or healing rates. &lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: There is little evidence to indicate which dressings or topical agents are the most effective in the treatment of chronic wounds. However, there is evidence that hydrocolloid dressings are better than wet-to-dry dressings for the treatment of pressure sores. In the treatment of venous ulcers, low adherent dressings are as effective as hydrocolloid dressings beneath compression bandaging.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Wound dressings are designed to keep the wound clean and free from contamination and also to promote wound healing, particularly in chronic wounds where there may be significant tissue loss.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Nineteen electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Wounds Group’s specialised trials register and wound care journals were searched until October 1997. Organisations, manufacturers, researchers and healthcare professionals concerned with wound care were contacted for additional trials. The reference sections of obtained studies were also searched for further trials. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, which assessed the effectiveness of a dressing or topical agent in the treatment of pressure sores, leg ulcers, sinuses and surgical wounds healing by secondary intention were included in the review. Where a particular dressing was not evaluated by an RCT, prospective controlled trials were included. Studies were only included if they reported either the proportion of wounds healed within a time period or the percentage or absolute change in wound area. Trial data were extracted by one researcher and checked by a second. The results from each study were calculated as odds ratios and/or effect sizes and where appropriate, similar studies have been pooled in a meta-analysis.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Both NRT and bupropion SR are effective interventions to assist smoking cessation. 
&lt;LI&gt;The relative effectiveness of bupropion SR and NRT still needs further research. 
&lt;LI&gt;Information on how to maximise effectiveness in practice is still lacking, but motivational support is probably involved. 
&lt;LI&gt;The most significant differences between NRT and bupropion SR relate to the adverse events and safety profiles of these interventions. 
&lt;LI&gt;Overall, the safety profile of NRT is more favourable, particularly given the small but real risk of seizure with bupropion SR. 
&lt;LI&gt;Irrespective of the methods used or the assumptions involved, the results of existing economic evaluations and the model developed in this review consistently suggest that smoking-cessation interventions, including the use of NRT and/or bupropion SR, are relatively cost-effective in terms of the cost per life-year saved. The worst-case scenarios still provide estimates of cost-effectiveness better than many other medical interventions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The health hazards of smoking are significant and well established. Giving up smoking is difficult and therefore needs to be treated as a chronic, but potentially curable, illness. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion sustained-release formulation (SR) (Zyban&lt;SUP&gt;®&lt;/SUP&gt;) are two pharmacological agents available to aid smokers in their attempts to achieve smoking cessation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Twenty-six electronic databases and Internet resources were searched from inception to May 2001. In addition, the bibliographies of retrieved articles and submissions received from the manufacturers were searched. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts for relevance and made final decisions regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies based on full paper copies of manuscripts. Studies were assessed according to predefined criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and, where necessary, a third reviewer was consulted. Only systematic reviews and newly identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of bupropion SR (used alone or as part of a combination therapy with motivational support or motivational support and NRT) or any type of NRT were included in the review of clinical effectiveness. Participants included smokers of any age or gender and studies had to report abstinence (preferably continued rather than point abstinence) as an outcome measure. In addition, the assessment of adverse effects also included non-RCTs, case-controlled studies, uncontrolled studies and surveillance studies, the primary objective of which was the investigation of the adverse effects, tolerability or safety of bupropion SR or bupropion immediate-release (IR) and/or NRT. Case reports and case series were also documented. The economic assessment included evaluations of the cost-effectiveness or cost–utility of bupropion SR and/or NRT. Data were extracted into an Access database by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. The quality of each study was assessed using predefined criteria specified according to study design. The assessment was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements were resolved through consensus and, if necessary, a third reviewer was consulted. Study details, validity and data were reported in structured tables and discussed in the text of the review. For the assessment of clinical effectiveness, where available and appropriate, pooled estimates of effect in the form of odds ratios from systematic reviews are presented. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses are reported where data are available. For the assessment of adverse events and safety the summary was mainly a narrative one. In the assessment of cost effectiveness, evaluations were grouped according to design.&lt;/P&gt;

    <title>The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sibutramine in the management of obesity : a technology assessment</title>

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Although many trials demonstrated statistically significant differences between groups in terms of weight loss in favour of sibutramine versus placebo, the differences may not always be of clinical significance. The clinical significance of between-group differences for secondary outcomes may also be debatable. Possible adverse effects should be taken into account when prescribing sibutramine.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The prevalence of obesity in developed societies is increasing. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of co-morbidity, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Following the withdrawal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in 1997, interest has focused on a novel anti-obesity drug: sibutramine. (Note: since the completion of this review, phentermine has been withdrawn from the market – May 2001.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A total of 19 electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2000. Additionally, Internet searches were carried out, bibliographies of retrieved articles were examined, and a submission was received from the manufacturer of sibutramine. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of sibutramine used for weight loss or maintenance of weight loss in overweight or obese patients were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were changes in body weight, fat content or fat distribution. Secondary outcomes were changes in obesity-related risk-factor profiles, such as lipid levels, indicators of glycaemic control and blood pressure. Studies recruiting people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were excluded. The assessment of titles and abstracts was performed independently by two reviewers. If either reviewer considered a reference to be relevant, the full paper was retrieved. Two independent reviewers assessed full papers against the review selection criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into structured summary tables and checked by a second reviewer. Any disagreements about data were resolved by discussion. Each included trial was assessed against a comprehensive checklist for methodological quality. Quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by discussion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This report is a narrative summary, with results grouped according to study endpoint. Statistical pooling was undertaken in groups of trials that were considered to be sufficiently similar. Relevant economic evaluations were identified from the search strategy described above. Assessment of methodological quality was undertaken using principles outlined in published guidelines. Data provided by the manufacturer of sibutramine were subject to the same selection and appraisal processes as other studies considered for inclusion in the review, except that only RCTs with a duration of at least 1 year were selected.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In carotid artery disease, 2D and 3D TOF MRA techniques are accurate for identifying both occlusions and 70–99% stenoses as defined by conventional angiography. The evidence does not support their use for identifying 50–99% stenoses. If the utilisation rate for an MRA system to evaluate all patients (with and without carotid artery disease) is greater than 10%, then MRA is likely to be a cost-effective option. In peripheral vascular disease the evidence supports the use of 2D TOF and contrast-enhanced MRA techniques for identifying occlusions and 50–100% stenoses. If both DSA and MRA are already available in the local setting, then MRA is more cost-effective than DSA, especially if contrast-enhanced MRA is available. The conclusions about cost-effectiveness are valid only for high-quality diagnostic studies. Such examinations can only be performed following training and adequate experience. Consequently, there is a case for guidelines, training and accreditation schemes to be established by the relevant professional bodies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The principal manifestations of carotid and peripheral atherosclerosis, respectively, include transient ischaemic attack and stroke, and lower limb arterio-occlusive disease resulting in intermittent claudication (pain on walking), ischaemic rest pain, ulceration or gangrene. The total costs to the NHS of arterial and venous disease, in hospital and primary care, exceed £350 million; the total costs of stroke have been estimated as substantially higher, at 5.8% of total expenditure. Clinical decision-making relies on evaluation of the vessels in terms of the degree of stenosis, or narrowing. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a technique for imaging blood vessels that contain flowing blood. It can be performed on most magnetic resonance scanners installed in hospitals today, and represents an alternative to conventional angiographic techniques using X-rays (digital subtraction angiography (DSA)), or more recent imaging developments, including ultrasound. In this review the use of contrast-enhanced MRA and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) MRA for presurgical assessment in carotid artery disease and in peripheral vascular disease is considered.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, Science Citation Index, Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings, the Cochrane Library, Inside from the British Library, EconLIT, HEED, the NHS EED and the Online Computer Library Centre, 1990–1999. A limited Internet search for reviews, 1990–1999. A handsearch of ten key journals and the Department of Health databases (Hospital Episode Statistics and Health Related Resource Groups), 1990–1999. Studies of the diagnostic performance of MRA in the relevant clinical conditions and performed on humans were included with two provisos: that sufficient data were reported for the construction of a 2 x 2 contingency table, and that application-specific inclusion criteria were satisfied. Non-English-language studies were included. Studies reporting cost data were included, providing resource use and costs for the UK setting were reported separately, and providing the study did not use expert opinion or charge data to estimate costs. Checklists that covered study design, patient characteristics, technical details and potential biases in study execution were completed independently by two reviewers. Consensus was reached on any disagreements. One reviewer, who worked with another where difficulty arose, extracted results on diagnostic performance. Summaries were written to describe each article. Cost data were extracted and summarised by two team members.&lt;/P&gt;

    <title>The impact of screening on future health-promoting behaviours and health beliefs : a systematic review</title>

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusion: &lt;/STRONG&gt;The studies reviewed suggest that cholesterol screening had a positive effect on health behaviours. However, these positive findings need to be interpreted in the light of methodological issues. For example, participation was voluntary and those screened were possibly more motivated to make changes. These results are therefore not generalisable to the entire population. Other factors include the lack of reliability and validity of tools to measure changes in health behaviours, study attrition and uncertainty of self-reports. Furthermore, uncertainty of long-term changes, inaccurate risk assessment, perception of cholesterol testing in a non-medical environment, perception of seriousness of the risk status due to lack of symptoms, readiness to accept advice, and convenience and cost of follow-up should all be considered. Reduction in blood cholesterol levels was reported in all but two of the studies that assessed this outcome, suggesting that successful lifestyle changes were made. However, as most of the studies only reported follow-up of those screened, some of the reduction can be attributable to regression to the mean.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The review focuses on two types of screening: risk factor screening (cholesterol) and screening for early disease (breast and cervical cancer). Risk factor screening involves a strategy for primary prevention, whereas early or preclinical disease screening is secondary prevention. Screening can be delivered as a systematic programme, an ‘opportunistic’ programme or an ‘open-access’ programme. A systematic programme is provider led and will actively seek out the eligible population and invite them to participate in screening. Opportunistic screening occurs when a patient consults a health professional about an unrelated problem, and the opportunity is taken (by a healthcare provider) to offer and conduct the screening. Open-access screening is user led, where the screened population is self-selected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Systematic searches of 11 electronic databases (between 1980 and 2000) were conducted. All English language studies that investigated the impact of cholesterol, breast and cervical screening programmes on health-promoting behaviours and beliefs were assessed for inclusion. The data extraction form and quality assessment criteria were developed using the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Initially, two reviewers extracted data and disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. This procedure was changed owing to the large number of papers involved, to data being extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer; any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Data were extracted and a non-quantitative synthesis was conducted. Reviewers categorised the outcomes into those that could be considered beneficial or detrimental to health. This categorisation was based on a value judgement that considered both statistical and clinical significance.&lt;/P&gt;

    <description></description>
    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;:The use of standardised, valid and reliable definitions is fundamental to the accurate measurement and monitoring of surgical adverse events. This review found inconsistency in the quality of reporting of postoperative adverse events, limiting accurate comparison of rates over time and between institutions. The duration of follow-up for individual events will vary according to their natural history and epidemiology. Although risk-adjusted aggregated rates can act as screening or warning systems for adverse events, attribution of whether events are avoidable or preventable will invariably require further investigation at the level of the individual, unit or department. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Surgical adverse events contribute significantly to postoperative morbidity, yet the measurement and monitoring of events is often imprecise and of uncertain validity. Given the trend of decreasing length of hospital stay and the increase in use of innovative surgical techniques, particularly minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures, accurate measurement and monitoring of adverse events is crucial.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Four adverse events were selected on the basis of their frequency of occurrence and likelihood of evidence of measurement and monitoring:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;surgical wound infection 
&lt;LI&gt;anastomotic leak 
&lt;LI&gt;deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
&lt;LI&gt;surgical mortality.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Surgical wound infection and DVT are common events that cause significant postoperative morbidity. Anastomotic leak is a less common event, but risk of fatality is associated with delay in recognition, detection and investigation. Surgical mortality was selected because of the effort known to have been invested in developing systems for monitoring surgical death, both in the UK and internationally. Systems for monitoring surgical wound infection were also included in the review. Thirty separate, systematic literature searches of core health and biomedical bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR and the Cochrane Library) were conducted. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed to locate additional articles. A matrix was developed whereby different literature and study designs were reviewed for each of the surgical adverse events. Each article eligible for inclusion was independently reviewed by two assessors. Studies were appraised according to predetermined assessment criteria. Definitions and grading scales were assessed for: content, criterion and construct validity; repeatability; reproducibility; and practicality (surgical wound infection and anastomotic leak). Monitoring systems for surgical wound infection and surgical mortality were assessed on the following criteria:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;coverage of the system 
&lt;LI&gt;whether or not denominator data were collected 
&lt;LI&gt;whether standard and agreed definitions were used 
&lt;LI&gt;inclusion of risk adjustment 
&lt;LI&gt;issues related to data collection 
&lt;LI&gt;postdischarge surveillance 
&lt;LI&gt;output in terms of feedback and wider dissemination.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Information taken directly from the abstract:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp;No clinical studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for the review. Our mathematical model estimates that undertaking thrombophilia testing on patients with PE has a mean cost per QALY below £20,000 regardless of sex or age, although there is great uncertainty around these values. In patients with a previous DVT, thrombophilia testing has an estimated mean cost per QALY below £20,000 in men aged 69 years or less and in women aged 49 years or less, but again there is great uncertainty in the values. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Thrombophilias are heritable [such as factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTG20210A)] or acquired (such as lupus anticoagulant) defects in blood coagulation that lead to a predisposition towards thrombosis. A thrombus is a solid mass of blood constituents that can fragment and block vessels downstream (thromboembolism). Depending on the blood vessel occluded, venous thromboemboli can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) or, rarely, stroke. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A comprehensive search was undertaken to systematically identify clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature comparing thrombophilia testing of patients with thrombosis with no testing, and the resulting long-term anticoagulation management and outcomes. A discrete event simulation model was constructed that assessed the cost-effectiveness of changing the standard 3-month duration of warfarin treatment to 10 years, 20 years or lifelong. The model was run for both sexes, using hypothetical cohorts of patients assumed to be 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 years of age. Separate analyses were conducted for patients in whom the initial venous thromboembolic event (VTE) was a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and for those in whom the initial VTE was a PE. &lt;/P&gt;

    <title>Towards evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism : systematic reviews of mechanical methods, oral anticoagulation, dextran and regional anaesthesia as thromboprophylaxis</title>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In the absence of a clear contraindication (such as severe peripheral arterial disease), patients undergoing a surgical procedure would be expected to derive net benefit from a mechanical compression method of thromboprophylaxis (such as graduated compression stockings), irrespective of their absolute risk of venous thromboembolism. Patients who are considered to be at particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism may also benefit from a pharmacological thromboprophylactic agent, but since oral anticoagulant and dextran regimens appear less effective at preventing DVT than standard low-dose unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin regimens, they may be less suitable for patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism, even though they are associated with less bleeding. Whenever feasible, the use of regional anaesthesia as an alternative to general anaesthesia may also provide additional protection against venous thromboembolism. There is little information on the prevention of venous thromboembolism among high-risk medical patients (such as those with stroke), so further randomised trials in this area would be helpful.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The objectives of this study were to assess the benefits in terms of reductions in the risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and of pulmonary embolism (PE), and hazards in terms of major bleeding, of: (i)&amp;nbsp;mechanical compression (graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, footpumps); (ii)&amp;nbsp;oral anticoagulants; (iii)&amp;nbsp;dextran; and (iv)&amp;nbsp;regional anaesthesia (as an alternative to general anaesthesia) in surgical and medical patients.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The strategy involved a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Derwent), search of the Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration database, contact with trialists and manufacturers, and scrutiny of bibliographies of identified papers and reviews of thromboprophylaxis. Properly randomised trials were selected, including those reported in a non-English language, with at least one unconfounded comparison of the effect of one of the methods under review versus control, or a direct comparison between different versions of a method, or a direct comparison between a pharmacological agent (dextran or an oral anticoagulant) and low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin. Trials were included only if systematic assessment of DVT by radiological methods was planned. All trials identified as fitting the selection criteria were independently assessed by at least two review authors for methodological quality and the numbers of patients with primary and secondary outcomes were recorded. The primary outcomes were DVT, PE and major bleeding events, and proximal venous thrombosis (PVT) and fatal PE were secondary outcomes. Trials were subdivided into those that had assessed a method as the only means of thromboprophylaxis (‘monotherapy’) and those that had assessed the effects of adding a method to another form of thromboprophylaxis (‘adjunctive therapy’).&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Aims:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Varicose veins are veins that have become wider than normal and are unable to transport blood properly. Symptoms include heaviness, aching, throbbing, itching, cramps or fatigue in the legs. In severe cases, patients may have skin discolouration, inflammation, or skin ulcers. Foam sclerotherapy involves injecting a foam (which may either be a prepared product, or produced by mixing a chemical with air or other gas) into the affected vein which inflames the vein and causes it to close. Patients may need more than one injection to block the vein.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intended audience:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Cardiovascular surgeons.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Publication history information:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Published 26 August 2009. NICE Interventional Procedure Guidance 314. This replaces previous NICE guidance Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins (IPG217, May 2007) and Ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins (IPG182, June 2006).&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;This guidance is about the care and treatment of people who are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while in hospital in the NHS in England and Wales.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The advice in the NICE guideline covers the care and treatment that should be offered to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;all adults (aged 18 and over) who are admitted to hospital as inpatients (including those admitted for day-case procedures).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It does not cover the care and treatment that should be offered to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;people under the age of 18 
&lt;LI&gt;people attending hospital as outpatients 
&lt;LI&gt;people attending emergency departments who are not admitted to hospital 
&lt;LI&gt;older people who are cared for at home or in residential care homes 
&lt;LI&gt;people who are immobile and are cared for at home or in residential care homes 
&lt;LI&gt;people who are admitted to hospital because they have a diagnosis or signs and symptoms of DVT or pulmonary embolism.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is an update of advice on ‘Reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism in inpatients undergoing surgery’ that NICE produced in April 2007, and replaces it.&lt;/P&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Author's conclusions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The 4LB, which is currently the UK standard compression bandage for people with venous leg ulcers, was more clinically and cost-effective than the SSB.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The objective of this review is to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two different compression bandages for the healing of venous leg ulcers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methods&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an economic evaluation. Setting - community, district nurse-led services; community leg ulcer clinics; hospital leg ulcer clinics with community outreach. A range of urban and rural settings in England and Scotland. Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they presented with a venous leg ulcer of at least 1-week’s duration, at least 1 cm in length or width and an ankle:brachial pressure index of at least 0.8. The four-layer bandage (4LB) (which is multilayer elastic compression) compared with the short-stretch bandage (SSB) (multilayer, inelastic compression). The primary end-point was complete healing of all the ulcers on the trial leg. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients healed at 12 and 24 weeks, rate of recurrence, costs of leg ulcer treatment and quality of life.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom-line conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Based on the evidence to-date, the clinical effectiveness of VAC therapy in wound management is unclear. More rigorous RCTs assessing the use of VAC therapy on different types of wounds are required along with an independent economic evaluation from an NHS/UK perspective.&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom-line conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;:The RCT evidence base of the NICE IPG 163 was appraised (details available on request). The guidance appears generally sound. There does however appear to be a mismatch between the advice and the evidence concerning the effectiveness of endovascular stents in patients at sufficiently high operative risk that open repair would not be contemplated. The RCT, EVAR 2, addressing effectiveness in this patient population suggests that there is no clinical benefit, but much increased cost. These findings are not clearly reflected in the current NICE guidance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Evidence identified&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The following review underpins NICE IPG 163:&lt;/P&gt;

    <body>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom-line conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;: From the studies identified, EVLT looks like a hopeful technique to improve healing of chronic venous ulcers and reduce the rate of recurrence. Its effectiveness looks comparable with other surgical techniques also in use (Howard 2008).&amp;nbsp; It must be borne in mind that an ARIF request is not a full systematic review, therefore, there may be other primary studies that could contribute data but were not identified in this work. Aside from the size of the research base, there are also many clinical questions still to be answered, such as identifying the correct patient population, comparison with other effective treatments, and the effects on patients’ quality of life and costs to the health service. Given the prevalence and costs to society and the NHS, it is an area where more research should be undertaken so that the full spectrum of the disease process (i.e. venous incompetence) and the full range of treatment options can be assessed.&lt;/P&gt;

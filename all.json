The causes are considered to be postural change and increased levels of the hormone relaxin. Affected women should be advised that both core strengthening and aerobic exercise in water, at home or in group classes, can be beneficial. Massage has also been shown to be useful.<br /><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /?><p></p></p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>Symphysis pubis dysfunction is rarer, but the lack of rigorous criteria lead to difficulty in definition, and hence difficulty in estimating incidence (0.03 to 3% of pregnancies). For example, it is unclear whether the term applies just during pregnancy or post-partum as well. Pharmacological analgesia, sensitive to the demands of pregnancy, and physical support devices are recommended, but only one new study (n=90) supports this (Depledge et al., 2005).<br /><p></p></p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy has an estimated incidence of 21% to 62%. It is possibly due to increased fluid retention, and may be extended post-partum by breast feeding. Symptoms should resolve spontaneously, but if the nerve compression is severe and prolonged, permanent nerve damage and muscle wasting may result. There is no good evidence for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women. Interventions include analgesia, corticosteroid injection and, in extremis, surgery.<p> </p></p>\n<p>A thorough review found only eleven high quality studies (total n=472) from 1980 to 2005 which dealt with the effect of aerobic exercise (or advice on aerobic exercise) on the healthy mother and foetus, none of which provided strong evidence for benefit or harm. The only strong conclusion was that exercise improves the physical fitness of pregnant women. Notably, this systematic review was concerned with healthy women, not those reporting symptoms of symphysis pubis dysfunction (Kramer and McDonald, 2006). In contrast, a RCT (n=390) showed water aerobics to be superior to land exercise in both lower back pain relief (p=0.04) and consequent sick leave (p=0.03) (Granath et al., 2006).</p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2004 (n=301) reported a small but significant decrease in number of prolonged cases of second-stage labour, following 16 weeks of pelvic floor exercises. However, the reduction in average duration of second-stage labour was not statistically significant (p=0.06) (Salvesen and Morkved, 2004).</p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2007 (n=301, half with, half without symptoms at 24 weeks) of twelve weeks of aerobic and strengthening exercises reported significantly reduced lumbo-sacral pain at 36 weeks and three months post-partum, but no reduction in sick leave. A significant but slight increase was shown in functional measures of daily life. Note that exercise was in groups of subjects, and twelve were lost to follow-up (Mørkved et al., 2007)</p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>(post-partum conclusions: An assessor-blinded RCT of 118 women with pelvic girdle pain was conducted, comparing two different exercise groups to use of a support belt. Inclusion was at the point of presentation with three clinical measures of pain (2-30 weeks . The outcome measures was pain intensity and disability rating. Strengthening exercises were used. No significant differences were found between the clinic exercise group, home exercise group, or the support belt group.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Depledge, JM., McNair, PJ., Keal-Smith, C., Williams, M.(2005) Management of symphysis pubis dysfunction during pregnancy using exercise and pelvic support belts.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Breech presentation at term<p><strong>3.5 Breech presentation at term</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All women who have an uncomplicated singleton breech pregnancy at 36 weeks’ gestation should be offered external cephalic version (ECV). Exceptions include women in labour and women with a uterine scar or abnormality; fetal compromise; ruptured membranes; vaginal bleeding and medical conditions.</p>\n<p>A 2007 update of a Cochrane review concluded that attempting ECV at term reduces the chance of non-cephalic births and caesarean section.  There is not enough evidence from RCTs to assess complication rates but, large observational studies suggest that complications are rare. A 2007 Cochrane review concluded that compared with no ECV attempt, ECV before term reduces non-cephalic births. Compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation, and caesarean section. Further trials are needed to confirm this finding and to rule out increased rates of preterm birth, or other adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review reported that, although the methodological quality of the RCTs was not ideal, routine tocolysis appears to increase the success rate of ECV at term. Routine tocolysis with beta-stimulants was associated with fewer failures (6 trials, 617 women, relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.87).  One RCT (59 patients) reported in 2004 that compared with intravenous nitroglycerin, subcutaneous terbutaline was associated with a significantly higher rate of successful external cephalic version at term.  There is insufficient evidence to assess the role of epidural or spinal analgesia.</p>\n<p>Results from the Term Breech trial (1159 women recruited from 121 centres in 26 countries) indicated that planned caesarean section decreases the risk of adverse perinatal outcome due to both problems in labour (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.45, P &lt; 0.001) and delivery (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.87, P= 0.03) for the singleton breech presentation at term, compared with planned vaginal birth. A follow-up questionnaire (answered by 917 of the original mothers in the trial) reported in 2004 that planned cesarean delivery is not associated with a significant difference in maternal outcomes, or reduction in risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay in children at 2 years of age. A 2007 Cochrane review reported that planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced neonatal mortality and serious morbidity rates (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.56), at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61). </p>\n<p>A 2007 RCT concluded that a decision aid is an effective and acceptable tool for pregnant women that provides an important adjunct to standard counselling for the management of breech presentation. The decision aid used in this trial comprised a 24-page booklet supplemented by a 30-minute audio-CD and worksheet that was designed for women to take home and review with a partner.</p>\n<p>A Cochrane review in 2005 reported that further research is needed to determine whether maternal posture promotes cephalic version for pregnant women with breech presentation. The review found methodological and conceptual issues which threatened the internal validity of current trials. A 2007 Cochrane review found conflicting evidence that use of the hands and knees position for 10 minutes twice daily was useful to correct occipitoposterior position of the fetus in late pregnancy. They concluded that the technique cannot currently be recommended as an intervention but suggest that further trials are justified. </p>\n<p>A 2007 systematic review concluded that antepartum ultrasonography is more accurate than digital vaginal examination in diagnosing fetal malposition.</p>\n<p>An RCT (with only 67 patients) in 2003 concluded that acupuncture correction of fetal malpresentation is a relatively simple, efficacious and inexpensive method associated with a lower percentage of operatively completed deliveries.</p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (3 trials, 597 women) reported in 2005 that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of moxibustion (a type of Chinese medicine which involves burning a herb close to the skin) to correct breech presentation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Tocolysis for repeat external cephalic version in breech presentation at term: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Diet<p><strong>1.3 Diet</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pregnant women (and those intending to become pregnant) should be informed that dietary supplementation with folic acid, before conception and up to 12 weeks’ gestation, reduces the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. The recommended dose is 400 micrograms per day (a 2004 RCT reported that this dosage may need to be adjusted for smokers). A meta-analysis reported in 2006 that maternal consumption of folic acid-containing prenatal multivitamins is associated with decreased risk for several congenital anomalies, not only neural tube defects. The strongest evidence exists for prevention of cardiovascular and limb defects, with more debateable evidence for prevention of cleft palate, urinary tract anomalies and hydrocephalus. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>Iron supplementation should not be offered routinely to all pregnant women because of potential side-effects; a systematic review concluded in 2006 that the risk of haemoconcentration is reduced in weekly supplementation compared to daily supplementation. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>Vitamin A supplementation (intake greater than 700 micrograms) might be teratogenic and therefore should be avoided. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin A supplements can reduce maternal mortality, although one recent RCT has reported a beneficial effect (when taken with iron) in women who were anaemic.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>There is insufficient evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy other than one RCT which suggested protection against tooth decay.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>There is significant debate but insufficient evidence to support supplementation during pregnancy with vitamin C. The most recent systematic review (2007), incorporating 4 trials and a total of 4,680 women receiving a combined intervention of vitamin C and vitamin E, showed no significant differences between vitamin and placebo groups for prevention of pre-eclampsia, fetal or neonatal loss, small for gestational age infant or preterm birth. A Cochrane review in 2005 had concluded that vitamin C supplements did not significantly affect rates of stillbirth, perinatal death, birthweight or intrauterine growth restriction. </p>\n<p>There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D effectiveness in pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (2005) which did not differentiate between vitamins, reported that taking vitamin supplements, alone or in combination with other vitamins, prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy, does not prevent miscarriage or stillbirth. However, women taking vitamin supplements appeared less likely to develop pre-eclampsia (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.85, four trials, 5580 women) and more likely to have a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.70, three trials, 20,986 women).  <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The risk of listeriosis can be reduced by drinking only pasteurised or UHT milk; avoiding mould-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, pate and undercooked ready-meals. The risk of salmonella infection can be reduced by avoiding undercooked eggs (or food containing eggs) and meat (especially poultry).</p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review  (6 trials, 2783 women) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of marine oil or other prostaglandin precursor supplements during pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight or small-for-gestational age infants. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A systematic review reported in 2007 a possible inverse association between maternal calcium intake during pregnancy and offspring blood pressure, but the authors concluded that the trials were under-powered and they recommended further research. A Cochrane review in 2006 reported that calcium supplementation appears to almost halve the risk of pre-eclampsia (12 trials, 15,206 women: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.69), with the effects greatest for high risk women and those with low baseline calcium intake. The WHO systematic review in 2006 found that calcium supplementation among low calcium intake pregnant women did not prevent pre-eclampsia but did reduce its severity, maternal morbidity and neonatal mortality.<br /><br /><br />A 2007 Cochrane review has shown that there is no evidence that a reduced salt intake during pregnancy lowers the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, although the authors stress that this is not related to altering salt intake as a treatment for pre-eclampsia.<br /></p>\n<p>A 2006 Cochrane review including 4 trials and 451 participants reported that an antigen avoidance diet for high-risk women is unlikely to substantially reduce her child’s risk of atopic diseases, and that such a diet may adversely affect maternal and/or fetal nutrition. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review of zinc supplementation during pregnancy found a small but significant relative reduction in preterm birth; the authors stressed that this effect was greatest in studies involving women of low income and that improving overall nutrition in these populations is a more urgent priority than micronutrient or zinc supplementation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Barden, AEM., Mori, TA., Dunstan, JA., Taylor, AL., Thornton, CA., Croft, KD., Beilin, LJ., Prescott, SL.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Emotional changes<p><strong>2.1 Emotional changes</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Common physiological, psychosocial and emotional changes in pregnancy include gingivitis (bleeding gums), heartburn (indigestion), constipation, vaginal discharge (thrush), varicose veins, haemorrhoids, anxiety, backache, peripheral oedema, itching, feeling hot and skin and hair changes. Although many of these changes are normal, pregnant women should be alert to symptoms of potentially harmful conditions (e.g. severe oedema with other symptoms and signs may indicate pre-eclampsia).<br /> </p>\n<p>Many of these changes may be due to either hormonal changes taking place during pregnancy or worries associated with pregnancy, such as concerns about the birth or baby’s wellbeing. It is important for pregnant women to be reassured that most symptoms of pregnancy are not putting them or their fetus in danger and to be made to feel comfortable about asking their healthcare provider about these changes.<br /><br /><br />In 2006 an RCT with 227 participating pregnant women reported that the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) is successful at eliciting risk factors of postpartum depression (PPD). The authors stress, however, that the detection of depressive symptoms during pregnancy remains problematic (Blackmore et al., 2006).<br /><br /><br />A 2007 Cochrane review examined the various interventions available to prevent women developing PPD. Fifteen trials involving over 7600 women were included. Purely postnatal psychosocial interventions to reduce the numbers of women who develop PPD appear to more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than those that also include an antenatal component (Dennis and Creedy, 2000).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Blackmore, ER., Carroll, J., Reid, A., Biringer, A., Glazier, RH., Midmer, D., Permaul, JA., Stewart, DE.

A 2006 Cochrane review concluded there is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of exercise on prevention of pre-eclampsia. A systematic review in June 2003 found that antenatal pelvic floor exercises were not successful in reducing postpartum urinary incontinence. A 2007 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programmes.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /?><p></p></p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>Sexual intercourse during pregnancy is not known to be associated with any adverse outcomes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p>Excess alcohol has an adverse effect on the fetus. Pregnant women should limit their exposure to no more than one standard unit per day. An RCT with 304 participants reported in 2005 that a brief alcohol reduction intervention had most success in those pregnant women who were previously consuming the most alcohol; importantly, this effect was significantly enhanced when their partners also received the intervention.<p></p></p>\n<p><p></p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Smoking has specific risks during pregnancy (recently an RCT reported that it increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes) and quitting at any stage should be encouraged. Interventions that appear to be useful in reducing smoking include advice from a physician, group sessions, behavioural therapy, mental health counselling and point-of-care testing. A systematic review found that transdermal nicotine replacement therapies were safe in pregnant women but their efficacy is unclear. A 2004 Cochrane review concluded that smoking cessation programs in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.95), and reduce low birthweight (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94) and preterm birth (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98). The pooled trials have inadequate power to detect reductions in perinatal mortality or very low birthweight. An RCT found that advice to stop smoking was not associated with increases in maternal stress. One RCT found no evidence of pregnant women’s partners quitting smoking and suggests that future interventions should focus on encouraging both partners to quit together.<p></p></p>\n<p><p> </p></p>\n<p>The direct effects of cannabis on the fetus are uncertain but may be harmful. Women should be discouraged from using cannabis during pregnancy. A systematic review in 2004 reported clinical experience with anti-addictive medications for cannabis use in pregnant women was nonexistent.<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><br />1.

It therefore cannot be routinely recommended. Compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema, but seem to relieve symptoms (Bamigboye and Smyth, 2007).  There is not evidence about the safety of surgical approaches during pregnancy.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Vaginal discharge:<br />The amount and consistency of vaginal discharge changes throughout pregnancy as a physiological process.  However, if the discharge has an offensive odor and/or is associated with local pruritus or dysuria it is recommended to test for possible bacterial or fungal infections.<br />A recent update of a systemic review found that topical imidazole was more effective than nystatin, which had equal efficacy as hydragaphen.  Clotrimazole was more effective than placebo.  It appears that pregnant women should be treated for seven days with imidazole rather than for one to four days (Young and Jewell, 2007).<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Bamigboye, AA., Smyth, R.

Also, the detection of risk factors may be improved by administering a simple standardized measure of depressive symptoms during routine antenatal care.  However, there are no data to show that the assessment led to early interventions or had an effect on incidence or outcome of postpartum depression (Blackmore et al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Blackmore ER., Carroll, J., Reid, A., Biringer, A., Glazier, RH., Midmer, D., Permaul, JA., Stewart, DE.

It is recommended for both prescription and over-the-counter medicines to be taken only if the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are many RCTs or systematic reviews available looking at the use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs in pregnant women.  While many of them fail to assess maternal and/or fetal risks sufficiently there are a few new studies worth mentioning:<br />A systematic review looked at the use of common antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy with regard to potential adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the fetus.  Most studies failed to identify any significant detrimental outcomes with in utero exposure to monotherapy with carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbitone.  However, polytherapy exposure in utero was more commonly associated with poorer outcomes, as was exposure to any antiepileptic drugs when analysis did not take into account the type of drug.  The authors recommend treating pregnant women with monotherapy at the lowest possible dose to achieve seizure control (Adab et al., 2004).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another systematic review investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin as a preventative treatment for pre-eclampsia.  Aspirin was associated with reduced pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality rates as well as a reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth and an increase of 215 g in mean birth weight.  There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (Coomasaramy et al., 2003).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Recently, there have been a few RCTs looking at the use of alternative medicines and treatments during pregnancy:<br />• Relaxation techniques and micronutrient supplements have been shown to be beneficial in pregnancy (Ahn et al., 2006; Bastani et al., 2005). However, analyses revealed no added benefit of multiple-micronutrient supplements compared with iron folic acid supplementation (Haider and Bhutta, 2006).<br />• A systematic review found that moxibustion may reduce the need for external cephalic version for breech presentation.  However, the authors could not make a recommendation due to an insufficient sample size (Coyle et al., 2007).<br />• Acupuncture has been shown to relieve abdominal pain (Lund et al., 2006) and to reduce the use of paracetamol in pregnant women suffering from lower back pain (Guerreiro da Silva et al., 2003).  However, the numbers in these trials were small.  Another small RCT demonstrated that the use of acupuncture reduces the need for external cephalic version in breech presentation.<br />• Acupressure over the volar aspect of the wrist at the P6 point does not seem to result in a significant reduction in the amount of antiemetic medication, the requirement for intravenous fluid, or median duration of in-patient stay in women hospitalised for hyperemesis gravidarum.  (Heazell et al., 2006).  Low-level nerve stimulation therapy at the P6 point seems to have a beneficial effect in treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (Rosen et al., 2003).<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Adab, N., Tudur, SC., Vinten, J., Williamson, P., Winterbottom, J.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy<p><strong>2.2 Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More than 80% of pregnant women experience nausea and 50% vomiting in the first trimester.  The symptoms do not adversely affect the mother or fetus, but can have an impact on quality of life. Hyperemesis gravidarum is excessive vomiting leading to a state of fluid and electrolyte imbalance; it has an incidence of 3.5/1000 deliveries.<br /></p>\n<p>Pregnant women should be advised that nausea and vomiting are normal and harmless symptoms, which resolve spontaneously within 16 to 20 weeks gestation.  Symptomatic relief is available. Effective interventions are P6 acupressure, ginger and antihistamines. There is good evidence that antihistamines are safe in this context. Although one cohort study showed that vitamin B6 appeared safe, doubts about its safety still exist so it is not recommended (NICE guidance, 2003).<br /></p>\n<p>A systematic review looked at six studies (total n=675) and confirmed that ginger improves both nausea and vomiting (Borelli et al., 2005). The review lacked large enough data sets to be able to confirm the safety of ginger. Another systematic review in 2005 described doses of ginger up to 6g/day as safe, but recommended that it should only be administered in a clinical trial due to lack of good safety data (Betz et al., 2005).<br /></p>\n<p>Two RCTs (n=291, n=138) compared vitamin B6 to ginger. Both RCTs concluded on the basis of weakly significant results that both ginger and vitamin B6 were equally effective in reducing nausea and vomiting. Safety data for neither ginger nor vitamin B6 were reported (Smith et al., 2004; Sripramote and Lekhyananda, 2003).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>A review was undertaken of acupuncture for nausea and vomiting of any cause, including chemotherapy, motion sickness and pregnancy: results were mixed for pregnancy, but the review highlights the growing evidence for the general efficacy of acupuncture point stimulation (Streitberger et al., 2006).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>A RCT (n=230) compared acupuncture point nerve stimulation to placebo for mild to severe first trimester nausea and vomiting. This is in contrast to most other studies which involved in-patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. The study showed significant reduction of symptoms measured by the Rhodes index (P=0.02) thereby promoting weight gain (P=0.003) (Rosen et al., 2003).<br /></p>\n<p>A single-blind RCT (n=80) showed no reduction in anti-emetics required when acupressure was used (Heazell et al., 2006). Another single-blind study (n=66) showed no benefit of acupressure when compared to vitamin B6 (Jamigorn and Phupong, 2007) A trial (n=88) compared a combined acupuncture and acupressure regime with antihistamine plus vitamin B12. The trial was not blinded or placebo controlled. The trial measured somatic and functional improvement, showing similar benefit for both (Neri et al., 2005).<br /></p>\n<p>Two small RCTs (n=40, n=80) agreed that corticosteroids improved symptoms (Bondok et al., 2006; Ziaei et al., 2004). A slightly larger RCT (n=126) did not use symptomatic improvement as an end point, but showed hospital readmission was not reduced by adding a corticosteroid to an antihistamine regime (Yost et al., 2003).<br /></p>\n<p>There is no new evidence on the safety of vitamin B6 in pharmacological doses, although a drug containing it was withdrawn due to an apparent increase in limb abnormalities.<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Bondok, RSE.

There was less uterine hyperstimulation in those given oral misoprostol.  As oral misoprostol is not licensed in many countries for this indication and because of the risk of hyperstimulation and possibly uterine rupture it is however not recommended for use at the moment (Alfirevic and Weeks, 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Alfirevic, Z., Weeks, A.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Provision of antenatal care<p><strong>3.1 Provision of antenatal care</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Antenatal care in uncomplicated pregnancies should be midwife- and GP-led. There should be continuity of care throughout the antenatal period from a small group of carers with whom the woman feels comfortable. A clear system of referral paths should be established. The care should be sensitive to the needs of individual women and the local community.</p>\n<p>Structured maternity records should be used for antenatal care, and systems should be in place to ensure that women carry their own case notes. Nulliparous women with an uncomplicated pregnancy should have ten appointments during their antenatal care schedule, parous women should have seven.</p>\n<p>An RCT with 131 participants in 2007 reported that pregnant women in families at risk of abuse and neglect benefit from a weekly home visiting service from 6 months gestation to 12 months after delivery; statistically significant improvements were reported in maternal sensitivity and infant cooperativeness.</p>\n<p>A cluster randomized trial in Sweden with 1,700 participants concluded in 2007 that psychosocial support and risk assessment in early pregnancy are improved by combining the perspectives of midwives and doctors. 758 mothers had a routine early pregnancy risk assessment by a doctor; 942 women had a planning conference between a midwife and doctor. The degree of agreement in risk registration between the two groups was found to be good for previous pregnancy complications and recommendations for a doctor’s consultation; fair for social problems, and poor for registration of symptoms and problems in the index pregnancy, including psychosocial aspects such as anxiety.</p>\n<p>An RCT with 117 women in 2003 reported that provision of additional material (particularly an audiotape) following a prenatal scan appears to minimise anxiety compared with standard practice. Participants with suspected fetal anomalies were randomised to four groups: one was given a consultation and ultrasound report; the other three groups had this standard information and either audiotapes and/or a non-technical letter. Patient recall of the consultation was not altered by these extra interventions.</p>\n<p>A 2006 RCT with 540 participants in Sweden reported that mothers were more satisfied with emotional and information support after implementation of a process-oriented breastfeeding training program for antenatal midwives and postnatal nurses which focused on providing continuity of care. The results lend support to family classes incorporating continuity of care and in particular that health care workers should make every effort to have one face-to-face encounter to discuss breastfeeding with expectant mothers before they deliver.</p>\n<p><br /> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Barlow, J., Davis, H., McIntosh, E., Jarrett, P., Mockford, C.,  Stewart-Brown, S (2007) Role of home visiting in improving parenting and health in families at risk of abuse and neglect: Results of a multicentre<br />randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.

In other words, women’s choice should be an integral part of the medical decision-making process. This is particularly important for research trials, especially in critical situations. A recent trial investigated women’s experiences of being recruited into a large multicenter RCT of antibiotics in pre-term labour. Most women were satisfied with the written and oral information given by the health care professionals. However, it appeared that the stressful nature of the situation did decrease the women’s ability to understand the information fully, in particular trial design and practices. For example, many women believed that antibiotics were absolutely safe. The main motivation for trial participation was the possibility of an improved outcome for the baby.  The author suggested further research on how governance arrangements for trials can protect participating women and suggested investigating the interaction between research candidates and recruiters (Kenyon et al., 2006).</p>\n<p><br />Antenatal education in the UK is mostly delivered individually by midwifes and GPs, and in groups in antenatal classes. The authors state that the effects of general antenatal education for childbirth and/or parenthood remain unknown. A recent systematic review looked at the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. The authors found one RCT, which examined an educational intervention to increase vaginal birth after Caesarean section. Individual antenatal education did not increase the number of vaginal births after Caesarean section compared to routine information (Gagnon, 2006). However, a recent RCT demonstrated that a computer based decision aid for the mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section did increase vaginal delivery rates (Montgomery et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><br />Further, a decision aid for women with breech presentation at term resulted in increased knowledge and satisfaction, a reduced decisional conflict, and no increase in anxiety compared to usual care (Nassar et al., 2007).</p>\n<p><br />Antenatal education has been demonstrated to help when to stop smoking during pregnancy (Dornelas et al., 2006; Lumley et al., 2004) and to improve breastfeeding practice (Mattar et al., 2007). On the other hand, another RCT found that neither study intervention could be recommended as an effective strategy to increase breastfeeding initiation or duration in settings where breastfeeding initiation is already high, (Forster et al., 2004).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Dornelas, EA., Magnavita, J., Beazoglou T., Fischer, EH., Oncken, C., Lando, H., Greene, J., Barbagallo, J., Stepnowski, R., Gregonis, E.

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Ultrasound assessment in the third trimester<p><strong>4.3 Ultrasound assessment in the third trimester</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultrasound might carry small risks for the fetus and it has limited potential to improve outcomes in healthy women. If a routine ultrasound offered in the second trimester reveals the placenta lying across the cervical os, a further ultrasound should be performed in week 36. Most other low-lying placentas do not result in obstetric complications. If the placenta is in a normal position in the second trimester, there is no evidence that ultrasound scanning in the third trimester improves the outcome for mother or baby. <br />There is a known relationship between cervical shortening and pre-term birth. However, there is no evidence that knowledge of this condition improves outcome.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A literature review was conducted to determine the balance of benefits, harms and costs of ultrasound during pregnancy. The review recommended that ultrasound should be used sparingly and carefully, because of the potential for tissue heating, and damage thereby arising. Circumstances in which tissue heating was more likely or more dangerous were reported to be: first trimester with long transvesical path; bone being in focal zone; scanning poorly perfused tissue, notably embryonic tissue; and scanning febrile mothers. The higher energy forms of ultrasound, in particular Doppler ultrasound were recommended to be avoided completely in the first trimester, and not to be used more than medical advice dictates (Bly et al., 2005).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>A Canadian review of trans-vaginal ultrasound for the diagnosis of placenta praevia made similar recommendations to NICE in 2003: the placental edge reaching, or overlapping the internal os, is an indication for a follow-up ultrasound in week. If the placenta is found to overlap the os at that point then Caesarean delivery is indicated. The test has predictive power and improves outcome. This review also noted the greater accuracy of trans-vaginal as opposed to trans-abdominal ultrasound (Oppenheimer, 2007).<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A randomised prospective longitudinal study (n=200) in Malaysia concluded that cervical length determined mid-trimester by ultrasound was useful. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value were 77%, 95%, 56% and 98% respectively (Hebbar and Samjhana, 2006). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A study in South Africa (n=1920) looked at the relationship between maternal history and cervical length, determined by ultrasound, at 23 weeks. However, no results were reported or conclusion made about the predictive value of the measurement (Erasmus et al., 2005).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>A small Italian randomised study allocated 100 women to two groups, one of which received 2D and the other 4D ultrasound. The scans were performed in the second or third trimester. Although more women undergoing 4D ultrasound recognised details of their fetuses, no significant difference was reported in maternal attachment to their unborn fetus (Rustico et al., 2005).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Bly, S., Van den Hof, MC., Diagnostic Imaging Committee SoOaGoC.

The clinical features and diagnosis of endometriosis</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following symptoms have been associated with endometriosis:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Severe dysmenorrhoea (painful periods)<br />• Deep dyspareunia (pain on intercourse)<br />• Chronic non-menstrual pain<br />• Pain at the time of ovulation<br />• Dyschezia (pain on defaecation, especially at the time of menstruation)<br />• Cyclical or perimenstrual symptoms, affecting the bowel or bladder, with or without abnormal bleeding or pain<br />• Subfertility (difficulty conceiving for more 12 months)<br />• Chronic fatigue</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the predictive value of any one symptom or set of symptoms is uncertain because of the overlap with other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal disorders (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006.).  The difficulties inherent in interpreting such symptoms contribute to the well-recognised delay of up to 10 years between the onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who present with such symptoms, especially if there is a cyclical component.  A history and pelvic examination should be performed. There is evidence to suggest that performing the examination during menstruation helps to make the diagnosis, although many women are reluctant to be examined at that time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The pelvic examination may be entirely normal, but features suggestive of endometriosis include:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Generalised pelvic tenderness <br />• Fixed, retroverted uterus (due to adhesions and/or deeply infiltrating disease) <br />• Tender uterosacral ligaments (nodules may also be palpable) <br />• Enlarged ovaries<br />• Seeing lesions/nodules in the vagina or on the cervix</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds but it can only be confirmed on visual inspection of the peritoneal cavity at laparoscopy.  Histological confirmation of at least one lesion represents ideal practice, although if an endometrioma &gt; 4 cms in diameter or deeply infiltrating disease is present, histology <strong>should be obtained</strong> to exclude rare instances of malignancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disease severity should be assessed by documenting in detail the type, location and extent of all lesions and adhesions found at surgery.  Ideal practice is to record the findings on video or DVD as well.   Disease severity can be assessed quantitatively using a classification system such as the one developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  However, there is no correlation between such systems and the type or severity of pain symptoms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with an approximately 3% risk of minor complications, such as nausea or shoulder-tip pain, and a risk of major complications, such as bowel perforation, of between 0.6 to 1.8 per 1,000 procedures.  Therefore, a non-invasive test would be clinically useful. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following tests have been used with varying degrees of success:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Serum CA-125 (a test for ovarian cancer) – levels may be elevated in endometriosis but the test has little diagnostic value and is not recommended<br />• Trans-vaginal ultrasound – a useful tool to make and exclude the diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma, but it has limited value in diagnosing peritoneal disease.<br />• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – there is insufficient evidence at present regarding its diagnostic potential; however, MRI and other imaging modalities (e.g. transrectal ultrasound, IVP, barium enema) may have a role in defining disease extent in deeply infiltrating endometriosis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a woman with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis wants treatment without a definitive diagnosis, the options include counselling, analgesia and hormonal medication to reduce menstrual flow (e.g. progestagens or COC).  It is unclear whether the COC should be taken conventionally, continuously or in a tricycle regimen in such circumstances.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist may be taken, although this is an expensive option and concerns exist about the effects on bone mineral density (BMD).  It is also argued that establishing the correct diagnosis at laparoscopy before initiating therapy with significant short- and long-term side effects is the preferred approach (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References<br /></strong>The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2006). Treatment of pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.

Management of endometriosis-associated subfertility</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hypothesis that endometriosis causes infertility or reduced fecundity remains controversial.  There is a reasonable body of evidence associating endometriosis with infertility but a causal relationship has still not been established (ASRM Practice Committee - Infertility, 2006).  The mechanisms suggested as possible causes include:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Distorted pelvic anatomy<br />• Altered peritoneal function<br />• Altered hormonal and cell-mediated function<br />• Endocrine and ovulatory abnormalities<br />• Impaired implantation</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hormonal treatment for endometriosis-associated subfertility</strong></p>\n<p>• Suppression of ovarian function with hormonal medication in minimal-mild endometriosis does not improve fertility and should not be offered for this indication alone. <br />• More harm than good may result from such treatment because of side-effects and the lost opportunity to conceive.<br />• There is no evidence that hormonal medication is effective in more severe disease.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Surgery for endometriosis-associated subfertility</strong></p>\n<p>• Ablation of endometriotic lesions plus adhesiolysis to improve fertility in minimal-mild endometriosis is effective compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone.  The recommendation is based upon a systematic review and meta-analysis of two similar, but contradictory RCTs.  The combined data showed that surgery was beneficial for ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05, 2.57).  The number needed to treat is 12 (95% CI 7, 49), i.e. for every 12 women with minimal-mild disease diagnosed at laparoscopy, there will be one additional pregnancy if lesions are ablated at the time, compared to not treating them.<br />• Postoperative hormonal treatment does not have a beneficial effect on pregnancy rates.  <br />• The role of surgery in improving pregnancy rates for moderate-severe disease is uncertain.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>In vitro fertilisation (IVF) for endometriosis-associated subfertility</strong></p>\n<p>• IVF is appropriate treatment, especially if tubal function is compromised, if there is also male factor infertility, and/or other treatments have failed.<br />• A meta-analysis of published studies suggests IVF pregnancy rates are lower in endometriosis than in tubal infertility, but these results are not seen in large databases.<br />• A Cochrane review suggests that treatment with a GnRH agonist for 3-6 months before IVF increases the rate of clinical pregnancy in endometriosis-associated subfertility; however, the conclusion is based on one small RCT and there support for this strategy is not unanimous (ASRM Practice Committee - Infertility, 2006).  <br />• Ovarian endometriomas are believed to affect IVF pregnancy rates adversely.  The RCOG Guideline therefore recommends that laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy should be performed before IVF if an endometrioma =4cm in diameter.  However, in a recent meta-analysis, the odds for clinical pregnancy were not significantly reduced in women with an endometrioma compared to controls; overall odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.63, 1.81) (Gupta et. al., 2006).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong><br />The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2006).

Epidemiology and aetiology of endometriosis</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is difficult to define the epidemiology of endometriosis precisely because a surgical procedure is required to make the diagnosis definitively.  However, the following are best estimates: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Endometriosis affects 10-15% of all women in the reproductive years<br />• The incidence is 40-60% in women with dysmenorrhoea and 20-30% in those with subfertility.<br />• Risk factors include a heavy menstrual load (due to short cycle length and long duration of flow).<br />• Current/recent use of the combined oral contraceptive (COC), smoking and exercise may be protective.<br />• The sisters and daughters of affected women are 6-9 times more likely to develop endometriosis than women in the general population.<br />• Endometriosis is a considerable burden in terms of both direct and indirect healthcare costs, and its affect on quality of life (Gao et. al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the aetiology of endometriosis.  The most dominant theory is retrograde menstruation (the passage of viable endometrial cells along the fallopian tubes into the pelvis at the time of menstruation).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• However, retrograde menstruation occurs commonly in all women.<br />• It is likely therefore that aberrant function in related pathophysiological systems (e.g. immunity, cell clearance, angiogenesis) is responsible for the implantation and subsequent growth of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. <br />• The disease causes chronic inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cyst formation.<br />• Endometriosis has been associated in the past with various malignancies (e.g. ovarian cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma).

Non-surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis can be a chronic and debilitating disease, and few treatment options are entirely satisfactory. A cure may be achievable but for many women the medical and surgical treatments currently available have their limitations and symptoms often return after treatment. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some women prefer not to take hormonal medication and are able to control their symptoms with analgesics.  Although non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may relieve endometriosis-associated pain, there is too little evidence to assess their effectiveness.  NSAIDs have significant side-effects (e.g. gastric ulceration and an anti-ovulatory effect when taken at mid-cycle). Other analgesics may be effective but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is some evidence that high frequency TENS, acupuncture, vitamin B1 and magnesium may help to relieve dysmenorrhoea, but it is not known whether such treatments are effective in endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhoea. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women may rely on complementary medicine approaches (e.g. homeopathy, reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbal treatments).  There is no evidence from RCTs to support the use of these therapies in endometriosis but they should not be ruled out if the woman feels that they could be beneficial to her overall pain management and/or quality of life, or work in conjunction with more traditional therapies. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The options for hormonal treatment include the COC, progestagens, androgenic drugs and GnRH agonists. At appropriate doses, all suppress ovarian activity and menstruation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hormonal drugs studied - COCs, danazol, gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and GnRH agonists - are equally effective at relieving endometriosis-associated pain when prescribed for 6 months but their side-effect and cost profiles differ.  It is also important to bear in mind that:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• medical treatment does not always provide complete pain relief and some patients fail to respond at all. <br />• symptom recurrence is common following medical treatment. <br />• some side-effects limit long-term use and may produce poor compliance, e.g. GnRH agonist therapy may result in up to 6% BMD loss in the first 6 months and the loss may not always be entirely reversible. However, the concomitant use of ‘add-back’ (oestrogen and progestagen) therapy protects against BMD loss at the lumbar spine during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment.  <br />• the COC and Depo-Provera can be used long term, but danazol and GnRH agonists are usually restricted to 6 months; however, one study suggests 3 months with a GnRH agonist may be as effective as 6 months in terms of pain relief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is unclear whether hormonal treatment causes atrophy of endometriotic lesions, especially as the natural history of the untreated disease is unknown.  The available data suggest that MPA and luteal phase dydrogesterone are ineffective, whereas gestrinone may be effective. The effects of danazol and the GnRH agonist, triptorelin, are inconclusive (Carpenter, 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is emerging evidence regarding new hormonal therapies:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• pilot data indicate that the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, may be effective although it is associated with significant BMD loss.<br />• a systematic review identified a small number of studies suggesting that the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS) reduces endometriosis-associated pain with symptom control maintained over 3 years.<br />• postoperative use of the LNG-IUS may also reduce dysmenorrhoea recurrence rates in women who have had surgery for endometriosis (Abou-Setta et. al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong><br />The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2006).

    "description": "111-12007 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Surgical management<h3>7. Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surgery involves the excision/ablation of endometriotic lesions plus adhesiolysis.  The surgery is either conservative (i.e. the uterus and ovaries are preserved) or radical (i.e. the uterus and ovaries are removed), and it is preferably performed laparoscopically.  However, no RCTs have evaluated the different surgical techniques available (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conservative surgery<br /></strong>The results of two RCTs indicate that ablation of endometriotic lesions reduces endometriosis-associated pain compared to diagnostic laparoscopy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• The first RCT compared laser ablation of minimal-moderate disease plus laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA) versus diagnostic laparoscopy alone for pain relief.  At 6 months’ follow-up, 63% of treated patients reported symptom improvement or resolution compared to 23% in the no-treatment group.  Outcome was poorest in patients with minimal endometriosis.  <br />• In the second RCT, women with all disease stages were randomised to a diagnostic procedure or excisional surgery initially, followed 6 months later by a repeat laparoscopy at which any endometriosis present was treated.  Significantly more women (80% versus 32%) reported symptomatic improvement after initial excisional surgery than after placebo.  At 12 months’ follow-up, both groups reported a significant reduction in all pain parameters, except dyschezia, compared to assessment at 6 months.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It has subsequently become clear that there is no need to perform LUNA when ablating endometriotic lesions and LUNA by itself has no effect on dysmenorrhoea associated with endometriosis (Latthe et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The management of severe and deeply infiltrating endometriosis is complex.  Surgery is usually required and multiple organs are sometimes involved.  Therefore, if disease of such severity is suspected or diagnosed, referral to a centre with the necessary expertise to offer all available treatments in a multidisciplinary context, including advanced laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy, is strongly recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Radical surgery</strong><br />Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is generally reserved for women with debilitating symptoms attributed to endometriosis who have completed childbearing and in whom other therapies have failed (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).  If a hysterectomy is performed, all visible endometriotic tissue should be removed at the same time. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may result in improved pain relief and a reduced chance of future surgery. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended after radical surgery in young women given the overall health benefits, but there is controversy regarding the ideal regimen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unopposed oestrogen<br />• Advantages – standard treatment after hysterectomy as there is no need for endometrial protection<br />• Disadvantages – residual endometriosis may be reactivated or transformed into malignant tissue</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oestrogen plus a progestagen<br />• Advantages – may protect against unopposed action of oestrogen on residual endometriosis<br />• Disadvantages – increase in breast cancer risk associated with combined oestrogen and progestagen HRT and tibolone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The RCOG Guideline states ‘The ideal regimen for HRT after bilateral oophorectomy is unclear and should be discussed on an individual basis’, whereas the recently published ASRM Practice Committee Report states ‘Continuous combined oestrogen-progestagen therapy is the recommended regimen for treating menopausal symptoms in women with endometriosis, an exception to the usual recommendation for oestrogen only treatment after hysterectomy’ (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Role of medical treatment as an adjunct to surgery</strong></p>\n<p>• There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify the use of preoperative or postoperative hormonal treatment.<br />• In a small RCT, the LNG-IUS, inserted after laparoscopic surgery, significantly reduced the risk of recurrent moderate-severe dysmenorrhoea at one year follow-up.<br />• The results of one RCT indicate that immunomodulation with pentoxifylline after laparoscopic surgery is of no benefit (Alborzi et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References<br /></strong>The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2006).

This leads to a highly significant decrease in menstrual blood loss but its acceptability is limited by the high incidence of irregular bleeding and spotting that can persist for many months, progestagenic side effects and persistent abdominal pain.</li>\n<li>Tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (taken during the menses). These lead to a decrease of up to 50% in menstrual blood loss. Mefenamic acid is also useful in treating dysmenorrhoea. They are very safe and need only be taken for a few days each month. However, they should be stopped if there is no benefit after 3 cycles of treatment.</li>\n<li>Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or injected long acting progestogens (for at least 3 months). </li></ul><p>Of course, this depends on a number of factors, not least of which is if the woman wishes to conceive then a treatment that is a contraceptive would not be appropriate. Also insertion of the LNG-IUS is easier in multiparous women although data do not suggest that side effects are more common in those who have not been pregnant. Oral treatment can be commenced whilst waiting for the device to be inserted. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Surgical treatment<br /></em>Four surgical options recommended in the NICE guideline:</p>\n<ul><li>Endometrial Ablation is recommended where no pathology is found, but is not suitable if a woman wants to become pregnant in future.  Commonly used methods that have been subject to close scrutiny by the Health Technology Authority (HTA) are microwave endometrial ablation (MEA) and thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA). TBEA has recently been compared to the Cavertherm thermal balloon and both were found to be equally effective (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWRES\">Brun et al., 2006</a>). Ablation is probably less cost effective than the LNG-IUS although patients are attracted by the avoidance of long term therapy (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWRES\">Brown et al., 2006</a>). It can also be performed successfully as an outpatient (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWRES\">Marsh et al., 2007</a>).</li>\n<li>Uterine Artery Embolisation is recommended where fibroids are found and potentially allows woman to be able to become pregnant in future, but there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. UAE is an effective, safe and acceptable method of treating HMB (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWRES\">Writing Committee for the REST Trial participants, 2007</a>).</li>\n<li>Myomectomy is recommended where fibroids are found and potentially allows a woman to be able to become pregnant in future, but as with UAE, there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur.</li>\n<li>Hysterectomy is a very effective treatment for HMB but in general, is an option used where others have been considered and rejected. It is associated with complications although for some areas, e.g. sexual functioning, evidence suggests that this may improve rather than deteriorate as has been supposed in the past (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWRES\">Halmesmaki et al., 2007</a>) . However, there is no possibility of a woman becoming pregnant after procedure.</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>HMB is a common problem for women. However, it is reasonably simple to investigate and a number of effective treatments are available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=HMBNKWHOME\"><strong>Link back to AEU Homepage</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Backache, symphysis dysfunction and carpel tunnel syndrome<p><strong>2.4 Backache, symphysis dysfunction and carpel tunnel syndrome</strong>   </p>\n<p><br />  <br />Backache and Pelvic Pain<br />Backache affects about half of all women in pregnancy, half of whom report symptoms starting between the 5th and 7th months of pregnancy. The pain generally increases as pregnancy advances, interfering with daily activities, preventing women from going to work and disturbing sleep.  The exact aetiology remains unclear, but causes are thought to include postural change and increased levels of the hormone relaxin. Affected women should be advised that both core strengthening and aerobic exercise in water, at home or in group classes, can be beneficial. Massage has also been shown to be useful. <br /></p>\n<p>A thorough review (Kramer and McDonald, 2006) found only eleven high quality studies (total n=472) from 1980 to 2005 which dealt with the effect of aerobic exercise (or advice on aerobic exercise) on the healthy mother and fetus, none of which provided strong evidence for benefit or harm. The only strong conclusion was that exercise improves the physical fitness of pregnant women. Notably, this systematic review was concerned with healthy women, not those reporting symptoms of symphysis pubis dysfunction.  <br /></p>\n<p>In contrast, a RCT (n=390) showed water aerobics to be superior to land exercise in both lower back pain relief (p=0.04) and consequent sick leave (p=0.03) (Granath et al., 2006). <br /></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2007 (n=301, half with, half without symptoms at 24 weeks) of twelve weeks of aerobic and strengthening exercises reported significantly reduced lumbo-sacral pain at 36 weeks and three months post-partum, but no reduction in sick leave. A significant but slight increase was shown in functional measures of daily life. Note that exercise was in groups of subjects, and twelve were lost to follow-up (Mørkved et al., 2007).    <br /></p>\n<p>A recent Cochrane review (2007) looked at the evidence for preventing and treating back and pelvic pain in pregnancy.  Eight studies (1305 participants) were included looking at the effects of adding various pregnancy specific exercises, physiotherapy, acupuncture and pillows to the usual prenatal care.  There were no studies dealing specifically with the prevention of back and pelvic pain in pregnancy.  For women with low back pain, those participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises (standardized mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.40 to -4.27) and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain related sick leave (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI0.17 to0.92) versus usual prenatal care alone.  Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care, while acupuncture gave more relief to evening pain than exercises.  All but one of the studies included had a high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously.  While adding pregnancy specific exercises or acupuncture to normal prenatal care does appear to relieve back pain, the effects are small and it is unclear whether they actually prevent pain from starting in the first place.  Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work (Kihlstrand 1999) and acupuncture shows better results than physiotherapy.<br /></p>\n<p>A recent systematic review looked at the evidence for acupuncture as a treatment for back and pelvic pain in pregnancy (Ee et al 2007).  The review was limited by the small number of RCTs included (3); in addition, none of the trials included a placebo acupuncture arm.  Overall, the review found limited but promising evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in managing pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.<br /></p>\n<p>Elden et al (2008) followed up a RCT of women with pelvic girdle pain, comparing standard management with acupuncture (n=125), standard management with stabilising exercises (n=131) and standard management (n=130) alone to look beyond treatment of pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy to its regression post delivery.  They found approximately 3/4 of women were pain free 3 weeks post delivery and there was no difference in speed of recovery between the three treatment groups.  According to detailed physical examination, pelvic girdle pain had resolved in 99% of women by 12 weeks post delivery.<br /></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2004 (n=301) reported a small but significant decrease in number of prolonged cases of second-stage labour, following 16 weeks of pelvic floor exercises. However, the reduction in average duration of second-stage labour was not statistically <br />significant (p=0.06) (Salvesen and Morkved, 2004). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction<br />Symphysis pubis dysfunction is rarer, but the lack of rigorous criteria leads to difficulty in definition, and hence difficulty in estimating incidence (0.03 to 3% of pregnancies). For example, it is unclear whether the term applies just during pregnancy or post-partum as well. Pharmacological analgesia, sensitive to the demands of pregnancy, and physical support devices are recommended, but only one study (n=90) supports this conclusion (Depledge et al., 2005).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br />Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) during pregnancy has an estimated incidence of 21% to 62%. It is possibly due to increased fluid retention, and may be extended post-partum by breast feeding. Symptoms should resolve spontaneously, but if the nerve compression is severe and prolonged, permanent nerve damage and muscle wasting may result. There is no good evidence for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women. Interventions include analgesia, corticosteroid injection and, in extremis, surgery.<br /></p>\n<p>CTS during pregnancy is considered to have a short and relatively benign course.  Mondelli et al (2007) reported a 3 year follow-up after delivery of 45 women with CTS diagnosed on clinical and neurographic findings.  At three years, 51% were symptom free and 49% had anomalous (&gt;1) Boston Questionnaire (BQ) scores on symptoms and functional status, but mean BQ scores had improved from baseline and one year post delivery.  Only one woman underwent surgery and 11% continued to wear a splint at night at 3 years follow-up. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>1. Ee,C.C.; Manheimer,E.; Pirotta,M.V.; White,A.R.; (2008) Acupuncture for pelvic and back pain in pregnancy: a systematic review. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2008 Mar;198(3):254-9.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Breech presentation at term<p><strong>3.5 Breech presentation at term</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Babies with breech presentation are at increased risk of complications during birth. All women who have an uncomplicated singleton breech pregnancy at 36 weeks’ gestation should be offered external cephalic version (ECV). Exceptions include women in labour and women with a uterine scar or abnormality, fetal compromise, ruptured membranes or vaginal bleeding. Antepartum ultrasonography is more accurate than digital vaginal examination in diagnosing fetal malposition. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>External Cephalic Version<br />The recently updated 1996 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Kulier) of ECV for breech presentation at term included 5 RCTs (433 women) carried out prior to December 2004 assessing the effects of ECV at or near term (after 37 weeks) on measures of pregnancy outcome. The pooled data from these studies showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non-cephalic birth (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 - 0.80) and Caesarean section (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.91) when ECV was attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings &lt;7 at one or five minutes, low umbilical artery pH levels, neonatal admissions, perinatal death or time from enrolment to delivery. There was not enough evidence from the RCTs to assess complication rates but large observational studies at the time of writing suggested that complications are rare.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Is ECV before term more effective?<br />A Cochrane review in 2006 (Hutton and Hofmeyr) examined the effectiveness of ECV for breech presentation before term (&lt; 37 weeks). The review included 3 RCTs (515 women) and concluded that compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation and caesarean section. Further trials are needed to confirm this finding and to rule out increased rates of preterm birth or other adverse perinatal outcomes. </p>\n<p>In 2008 The Early ECV Group (Hutton et al.) published secondary analysis of the 178 women who had early ECV, as part of the RCT looking at procedural and pre-procedural factors associated with successful early ECV. Multiparity and a non-engaged presenting part were significant pre-procedural predictors of ECV success. The predictive procedural factors included lower reported maternal pain scores during the procedure, a single attempt at ECV and a more mobile fetus. Non-engagement of the presenting part was the only modifiable factor predicting ECV success that was identified in this analysis, and the authors conclude that this supports the hypothesis that beginning the ECV procedure earlier in pregnancy, prior to engagement, may have merit. </p>\n<p>The Early ECV 2 Trial (1480 participants) is currently underway comparing early ECV (34-35 weeks) versus ECV at term (=37 weeks); the primary and secondary outcomes are caesarean section and preterm labour respectively.</p>\n<p>Interventions to increase the success rate of ECV<br />Success rates of ECV vary widely (average = 58%, range 35-86%) and 1 in 6 successful cephalic versions revert back to a breech presentation. Tocolytic drugs to relax the uterus, as well as other methods, have been used in an attempt to facilitate successful ECV at term.</p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Gyte) included RCTs investigating the effects of routine tocolysis, fetal acoustic stimulation, epidural or spinal analgesia and transabdominal amnioinfusion for ECV at term. It concluded that, although the methodological quality of the RCTs was not ideal, routine tocolysis appears to increase the success rate of ECV at term. Routine tocolysis with beta-stimulants was associated with fewer failures (6 trials, 617 women, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.87). At the time of writing there was not enough evidence to evaluate the use of fetal acoustic stimulation, spinal or epidural anaesthesia or transabdominal amnioinfusion.</p>\n<p>A 2008 RCT (Weiniger et al.) with 70 nulliparous participants compared the success of ECV with and without spinal analgesia. Successful ECV occurred in 24 of 36 (67%) women who received spinal analgesia compared to 11 of 34 (32%) without (P=0.004). Spinal analgesia also resulted in a lower visual analogue pain score. Placental position, estimated fetal weight, and maternal weight did not contribute to the success rate when spinal analgesia was used. There were no cases of placental abruption or fetal distress.</p>\n<p><br />A 2004 RCT (El-Sayed et al., n = 59) compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous nitroglycerin with subcutaneous terbutaline (beta-2 agonist) as a tocolytic agent for ECV at term. Subcutaneous terbutaline was associated with a significantly higher rate of successful ECV compared with intravenous nitroglycerin (55% vs. 23%, p=0.02)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Mode of Delivery<br />Poor outcomes after breech birth may be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation or be related to factors associated with the delivery. Planned caesarean section has been randomised against planned vaginal delivery in several trials to assess the effect of mode of delivery on measures of pregnancy outcome.</p>\n<p>Results from the multi-centre Term Breech trial (Term Breech Collaborative Group 2004), in which 1159 women were recruited from 121 centres in 26 countries, indicated that planned caesarean section decreases the risk of adverse perinatal outcome due to both problems in labour (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.45, P &lt; 0.001) and delivery (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.87, P= 0.03) for the singleton breech presentation at term, compared with planned vaginal birth. </p>\n<p>A follow-up questionnaire, answered by 917 (79%) of the original mothers in the trial, reported in 2004 (Hannah M.E. et al.) that planned caesarean delivery is not associated with a significant difference in maternal outcomes, or reduction in risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay in children at 2 years of age. </p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Hannah M.E.), which included 3 RCTs (2396 participants), reported that planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced neonatal mortality and serious morbidity rates (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 - 0.56), at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 -1.61). </p>\n<p>A 2007 RCT (Nassar et al.) concluded that a decision aid is an effective and acceptable tool for pregnant women that provides an important adjunct to standard counselling for the management of breech presentation. The decision aid used in this trial comprised a 24-page booklet supplemented by a 30-minute CD and worksheet designed for women to take home and review with a partner. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Maternal Posture and Cephalic Version<br />Many postural techniques have been used to promote cephalic version.</p>\n<p>A Cochrane review in 2000 (Hofmeyr and Kulier) included 5 trials (392 women) comparing postural management with pelvic elevation for breech presentation versus a control. No effect of postural management on the rate of non-cephalic births was detected and the review recommended that further research in this area is needed.</p>\n<p>Complementary Therapy and Cephalic Version<br />A small RCT in 2003 (Habek et al., 69 participants) found that in women with breech presentation, 30 minutes of acupuncture a day from 34 weeks,  significantly increased the conversion of breech to cephalic presentation (76.4% v. 45.4% p&lt;0.01). They concluded that acupuncture correction of fetal malpresentation is a relatively simple, efficacious and inexpensive method associated with a lower percentage of operatively completed deliveries. </p>\n<p>A 2005 Cochrane review (Coyle, Smith and Peat), which included 3 RCTs and 597 participants, concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of Moxibustion (a type of Chinese medicine which involves burning a herb close to the skin) to correct breech presentation. </p>\n<p>A 2008 systematic review (van den Berg et al.) evaluated the effectiveness of ‘acupuncture-type’ interventions (moxibustion, acupuncture or electro-acupuncture) to acupuncture point BL 67 located at the tip of the 5th toe versus expectant management to correct breech presentation. It included 6 RCTs (818 women) and 3 cohort studies (606 women). In the RCTs, the pooled proportion of breech presentations was 34% (95% CI: 20-49%) following treatment versus 66% (95% CI: 55-77%) in the control group (OR 0.25 95% CI: 0.11-0.58). The pooled proportion in the cohort studies was 15% (95% CI: 1-28%) versus 36% (95% CI: 14-58%), (OR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.43). Including all studies, the pooled proportion was 28% (95% CI: 16-40%) versus 56% (95% CI: 43-70%) (OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15-0.46). The authors concluded that their results suggest that acupuncture-type interventions on BL 67 are effective in correcting breech presentation compared to expectant management. However, there are many flaws to the study including small sample sizes of RCTs; non-reporting of study design and certain outcomes in some studies; the use of a variety of interventions and protocols and a lack of placebo controls. Further RCTs of improved quality are necessary to answer this research question adequately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>1.  Hutton CA., Saunders M., Tu K., Stoll J., Berkowitz, Early External Cephalic Version Trial Collaborators Group.

Common pregnancy problems</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />  <br />Common physiological, psychosocial and emotional changes in pregnancy include gingivitis (bleeding gums), heartburn (indigestion), constipation, vaginal discharge (thrush), varicose veins, haemorrhoids, anxiety, backache, peripheral oedema, itching, feeling hot, and skin and hair changes. Although many of these changes are normal, pregnant women should be alert to symptoms of potentially harmful conditions (e.g. severe oedema, plus other symptoms and signs, may indicate pre-eclampsia). </p>\n<p><br />  <br />Many of these problems may be due to hormonal changes or worries associated with pregnancy, such as concerns about the birth or baby’s wellbeing. It is important for pregnant women to be reassured that most symptoms of pregnancy are not putting themselves or their fetus in danger; they should also  be made to feel comfortable about asking their healthcare provider questions about these problems. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?prv=y&amp;pagename=08ANCNKWC\">Link back to AEU contents page.</a></strong></p>\n<p><br /> </p>",

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Diet<p><strong>1.3 Diet</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Pregnant women (and those intending to become pregnant) should be informed that dietary supplementation with folic acid, before conception and up to 12 weeks’ gestation, reduces the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. The recommended dose is 400 micrograms per day (there is some evidence that this dose may need to be adjusted for smokers (Shikany et al., 2004)). A meta-analysis by Goh et al. (2006) reported that maternal consumption of folic acid-containing prenatal multivitamins is associated with decreased risk for several congenital anomalies, not only neural tube defects. The strongest evidence exists for prevention of cardiovascular and limb defects, with more debateable evidence for prevention of cleft palate, urinary tract anomalies and hydrocephalus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Iron supplementation should not be offered routinely to all pregnant women because of potential side-effects. An RCT (Casaneuva et al. 2006) showed that the risk of haemoconcentration is reduced in weekly, compared to daily, iron supplementation. A Cochrane review (Pena-Rosas &amp; Viteri, 2006) concluded that further studies are needed to assess the effects of routine antenatal iron supplementation on clinically important outcomes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vitamin A supplementation (intake greater than 700 micrograms) might be teratogenic and therefore should be avoided. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin A supplements can reduce maternal mortality and further work needs to be done in this area (van den Broek et al., 2002). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is insufficient evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy other than one RCT which suggested protection against tooth decay (Thaver et al. 2005).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is significant debate but insufficient evidence to support supplementation during pregnancy with vitamin C. The most recent systematic review (Polyzos et al. 2007), incorporating 4 trials and a total of 4,680 women receiving a combined intervention of vitamin C and vitamin E, showed no significant differences between vitamin and placebo groups for prevention of pre-eclampsia, fetal or neonatal loss, small for gestational age infant or preterm birth. A Cochrane review (Rumbold &amp; Crowther  2005) concluded that vitamin C supplements did not significantly affect rates of stillbirth, perinatal death, birthweight or intrauterine growth restriction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A review of the benefits of vitamin D supplementation was undertaken by the National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health for the NICE public health programme (2008). Vitamin D supplementation is advised for pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency, for example South Asian, African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern family origin, those with limited exposure to sunlight, or diet low in vitamin D. At the booking appointment all women should be informed of the importance of maintaining an adequate store of vitamin D and told that they can take 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day to achieve this. It is pertinent to check that women in high risk groups are taking this advice. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (Rumbold et al. 2005) which did not differentiate between vitamins, reported that taking vitamin supplements, alone or in combination with other vitamins, prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy, does not prevent miscarriage or stillbirth. However, women taking vitamin supplements appeared less likely to develop pre-eclampsia (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.85, four trials, 5580 women) and more likely to have a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.70, three trials, 20,986 women). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Helathy Start is a new NHS scheme that replaces the previous Welfare Food Scheme. Free vitamin supplements (Vitamin C, D and folic acid) are available for pregnant women who meet certain criteria (<a href=\"http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/index.asp\">http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/index.asp</a>).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The risk of Listeriosis can be reduced by drinking only pasteurised or UHT milk, avoiding mould-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, pâté and undercooked ready-meals. The risk of salmonella infection can be reduced by avoiding undercooked eggs (or food containing eggs) and meat (especially poultry).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A 2006 Cochrane review (Makrides et al.)  concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of marine oil or other prostaglandin precursor supplements during pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight or small-for-gestational age infants.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A systematic review (Bergel &amp; Baros, 207) reported a possible inverse association between maternal calcium intake during pregnancy and offspring blood pressure, but the authors concluded that the trials were under-powered and they recommended further research. A Cochrane review  by Hofmeyr et al.  (2006) reported that calcium supplementation appears to almost halve the risk of pre-eclampsia (12 trials, 15,206 women: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.69), with the effects greatest for high risk women and those with low baseline calcium intake. The WHO systematic review in 2006 (Villar et al.) found that calcium supplementation among low calcium intake pregnant women did not prevent pre-eclampsia but did reduce its severity, maternal morbidity and neonatal mortality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review (Duley &amp; Henderson-Smart) has shown that there is no evidence that a reduced salt intake during pregnancy lowers the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, although the authors stress that this is not related to altering salt intake as a treatment for pre-eclampsia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A 2006 Cochrane review (Kramer &amp; Kakuma) including 4 trials and 451 participants reported that an antigen avoidance diet for high-risk women is unlikely to substantially reduce her child’s risk of atopic diseases, and that such a diet may adversely affect maternal and/or fetal nutrition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review (Mahomed et al.) of zinc supplementation during pregnancy found a small but significant relative reduction in preterm birth; the authors stressed that this effect was greatest in studies involving women of low income and that improving overall nutrition in these populations is a more urgent priority than micronutrient or zinc supplementation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Villar et al. (2003) give a comprehensive review of nutritional interventions during pregnancy from an international persepective.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exposure of a fetus to maternal malnutrition has been shown in a systematic review to carry an increased risk of childhood obesity for that fetus (Huang et al., 2007). Low birth weight appears to be a risk factor for many common diseases later in life such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Maternal obesity can carry an increased risk of neural tube defects (Rasmussen et al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Emotional changes<p><strong>2.1 Emotional changes</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although pregnancy is often thought of as a time of emotional wellbeing, 15% to 25% of childbearing women develop a clinically significant mental heath disorder in the interval between conception and the first year postpartum.  It is important that women are made aware of symptoms and monitored throughout this period.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The prevalence rate of antenatal depression can range from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.8% in the second trimester.  Many women are concerned over drug effects on fetal and infant health and look to non-pharmacological treatment options (psychosocial or psychological interventions and interpersonal psychotherapy).  With these concerns in mind, a 2007 Cochrane review (Dennis et al.) examined the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological methods in the treatment of antenatal depression.  Only one small US trial met the inclusion criteria meaning the authors were unable to make any recommendations as to the use of interpersonal psychotherapy in antenatal depression.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2006, an RCT with 227 participating pregnant women reported that the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) successfully elicited risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD). The authors stressed, however, that the detection of  depressive symptoms during pregnancy remains problematic (Blackmore et al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Postpartum mood disorders can range from the mild “baby blues” experienced by 50% to 80% of new mothers, through PPD to postpartum psychosis affecting less than 1%.  A 2004 Cochrane review examined the various interventions available to prevent women  developing PPD. Fifteen trials involving over 7600 women were included. Purely postnatal psychosocial interventions to reduce the numbers of women who develop PPD appear to more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than those that also include an antenatal component (Dennis and Creedy, 2004).  However, many questions remain unanswered and much research is required in this area. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

A 2006 Cochrane review (Meher &amp; Duley) concluded there is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of exercise on prevention of pre-eclampsia. A systematic review  (Harvey, 2003) found that post natal, but not antenatal, pelvic floor exercises were successful in reducing postpartum urinary incontinence. A 2006 Cochrane review (Caysens et al.) found insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programmes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sexual intercourse during pregnancy is not known to be associated with any adverse outcomes. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Excess alcohol has an adverse effect on the fetus. Pregnant women should limit their exposure to no more than 1-2 standard units once or twice per week. Although it is uncertain how much alcohol must be consumed for the fetus to be damaged, there is little evidence of an effect at this low level. However, binge drinking, defined as more than 5 standard units on one occasion, should be avoided as it may be harmful to the fetus.  A recent systematic review of binge drinking in pregnancy  showed a possible adverse effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes but did not show any other convincing adverse effects (Henderson et al., 2007). An RCT (Chang et al. 2005) with 304 participants showed that a brief alcohol reduction intervention had most success in those pregnant women who were previously consuming high levels of alcohol; importantly, this effect was significantly enhanced when their partners also received the intervention. Women who are planning a pregnancy and those whose pregnancies are in the first three months should avoid alcohol altogether, as drinking alcohol probably carries an increased risk of miscarriage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Smoking in pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes: there is an increased risk of perinatal mortality, sudden infant death syndrome, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ectopic pregnancies, placenta praevia, preterm delivery, miscarriage, low birthweight and the development of cleft lip and cleft palate in children (DiFranza &amp; Lew 1995). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women planning to conceive or those already pregnant should be encouraged to stop smoking or, if not possible, to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. Interventions that appear to be useful in reducing smoking include advice from a physician, group sessions, behavioural therapy, mental health counselling and point-of-care testing. A 2004 Cochrane review (Lumley et al.) concluded that smoking cessation programmes in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.95), and reduce low birthweight (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94) and preterm birth (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98). The pooled trials have inadequate power to detect reductions in perinatal mortality or very low birthweight. An RCT (Aveyard et al. 2005) found that advice to stop smoking was not associated with increases in maternal stress. One RCT (Aveyard et al. 2005) found no evidence of pregnant women’s partners quitting smoking and suggested that future interventions should focus on encouraging both partners to quit together. UK statistics show that nearly half of all women who smoked prior to pregnancy quit smoking whilst they are pregnant. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The risks and benefits of nicotine replacement therapy should be discussed with pregnant women who smoke – there is some concern that nicotine may cause harm to the fetus via vasoconstriction. It should only be considered if attempts to stop smoking without it have failed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The direct effects of cannabis on the fetus are uncertain but may be harmful, especially as it is associated with smoking. Women should be discouraged from using cannabis during pregnancy. A systematic review of addiction in pregnancy (Rayburn &amp; Bogenschutz, 2004) reported that clinical experience of anti-addictive medications for cannabis (and other substances of abuse) was very limited and that further work on anti-addiction medications would be helpful. A recent study also showed that recreational drug use in early pregnancy is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis (Draper et al., 2008), along with cigarette smoking. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Gestational age assessment: LMP and ultrasound<p><strong>4.1 Gestational age assessment: LMP and ultrasound</strong> </p>\n<p><br />  <br />Dating of gestational age can be performed by calculation from the last menstrual period (LMP) using Naegele’s rule. Dating by the LMP is a simple, low cost method, but is limited by uncertainty over the LMP and concerns over delayed ovulation.  It is therefore recommended that all pregnant women should be offered an ultrasound dating scan between 10 weeks and 13 weeks and 6 days (NICE Guidelines 2008) to determine gestational age and detect multiple pregnancies. Accurate dating by ultrasound also enables optimal timing of screening for Down’s Syndrome and may reduce the rate of induction of labour after 41 weeks. A systematic review (Nielson 2001) of the use of ultrasound in early pregnancy included 9 RCTs and demonstrated a significant reduction in the rates of induced labour post-term. However, only 2 of these trials used ultrasound scans at less than 15 weeks.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2006, a RCT (Harrington 2006) looked at whether a first trimester dating scan using crown rump length (CRL) measurement reduces the induction of labour rate for prolonged pregnancy.  Gestational age was determined either by LMP or ultrasound measurement of the CRL between 8 and 12 weeks; 463 women were enrolled. For the scan group, the estimated date of delivery was altered if there was a discrepancy of more than 5 days compared with the LMP.  Although the trial had to be terminated early for unrelated reasons, no difference was found in the rate of induction for prolonged pregnancy between the scan (19 [8.2%]) and the no-scan (17 [7.4%]) groups.  The authors concluded, after acknowledging insufficient numbers were recruited, that there is no evidence that a first trimester ultrasound dating scan reduces the rate of induction of labour for prolonged pregnancy and that it may result in a more expensive healthcare strategy.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assessment of gestational age by measurement of CRL is most accurate in the first trimester, with 95% reliable prediction within 5 days (Robinson and Fleming, 1975). If a woman presents after 13 completed weeks of pregnancy, the head circumference or femur length should be used to determine the gestational age (BMUS guidelines).  Gestational age estimated by ultrasound scan in the second trimester is less accurate.<br />In order to calculate the gestational age from fetal measurements, a comparison is made with a gestational age specific reference.  The primary limitation of using ultrasound measurement for gestational age dating is therefore seen with symmetrically large or small fetuses where dates will be biased.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />More recent studies have looked at the use of transcerebellar diameter measurement for the prediction of gestational age in intrauterine growth restricted and large babies, creating specific normograms for such use.  Chavez et al (2007) demonstrated that for fetuses at the extremes of size, measurement of the transcerebellar diameter was a reliable and accurate method of predicting gestational age.</p>\n<p><br />  <br /> <br /><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong> </p>\n<p>1.

It therefore cannot be <br />routinely recommended. Compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema, but seem to relieve symptoms (Bamigboye and Smyth, 2007).  There is no evidence about the safety of surgical approaches during pregnancy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vaginal discharge <br />The amount and consistency of vaginal discharge changes throughout pregnancy as a physiological process.  However, if the discharge has an offensive odour and/or is associated with local pruritus or dysuria it is recommended to test for possible bacterial or fungal infections. </p>\n<p>A recent update of a systemic review found that topical imidazole was more effective than nystatin, which had the same efficacy as hydragaphen.  Clotrimazole was more effective than placebo.  It appears that pregnant women should be treated for seven days with imidazole rather than for one to four days (Young and Jewell, 2007). <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>2007 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong> </p>\n<p><br />1.

These factors can be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight and preterm delivery, but not mortality (Gisselman et al. 2008). The most important factor was job control, raising the question that this may be a psychosocial effect. Interestingly, for all birth outcomes the analysis detected class differences remaining even after working conditions were taken into consideration. Nevertheless, a cohort study found that psychosocial stress in the first half of pregnancy does not increase the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension (Vollebregt et al, 2008) – which has previously been a controversial issue. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One case-control study found associations between maternal work activity in pregnancy and pre-term delivery (Croteau et al. 2007). The associated activities included demanding posture for more than 3 hours per day, whole body vibrations, and high job strain, combined with low or moderate social support. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Current UK legislation decrees that all women are entitled to 26 weeks of ‘Ordinary Maternity Leave’ and 26 weeks of ‘Additional Maternity Leave’. In addition, a woman is not allowed to return to work within two weeks after giving birth nor is it lawful for the employer to require her or allow her to do so.  The pregnant woman’s GP or midwife has to inform the employer if she decides to work past 33 weeks gestation (Antenatal Care Guideline, 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Measurement of weight and body mass index, breast examination, pelvic examination, female genital mutilation, domestic violence and psychiatric screening<p><strong>3.2 Measurement of weight and body mass index, breast examination, pelvic examination, female genital mutilation, domestic violence, psychiatric screening</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are no new evidence-based data regarding breast and pelvic examination. For an overview of the current recommendations, please refer to the NICE guidelines. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Measurement of weight and body mass index<br />Maternal obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for many adverse pregnancy complications and outcomes. Three separate meta-analyses by Chu et al. in 2007 have shown maternal obesity to be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, Caesarean section and stillbirth. The risk of each of these outcomes rises with the severity of obesity. The normal range of gestational weight gain for each individual is enormously variable. Various tools have been devised to predict weight gain and fetal birthweight during pregnancy, and retention of weight post-partum.  In 2007 Kleinman et al. compared linear weight gain measurements with a novel area-under-the-weight-gain-curve method in an observational, prospective, cohort study with 2016 participants. This novel method was shown to be a better predictor of 12, 24 and 36 month weight retention; however, no method was better than any other at predicting birthweight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Female Genital Mutilation<br />Female genital mutilation is still a large problem in many countries.  A recent interagency statement by OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIFEM and WHO builds upon decades of action by local communities, governments, and national and international organisations to reduce the prevalence of female genital mutilation. A similar statement was issued in 1997, but this revised version has support from a wider range of agencies.  It is also based on new evidence that has come to light over the last decade, in particular that neonatal outcomes are worse in women who have been mutilated, with the severity of the outcome worsening with the extent of mutilation. The statement provides the framework required to work towards eliminating the practice worldwide; emphasises both the human and legal issues surrounding the problem, and reports the results of research investigating why the practice continues and the impact it has on the health of women and girls.<br /></p>\n<p><br />Domestic violence<br />Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common occurrence in pregnancy and results in an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Pregnancy increases the risk to women subjected to IPV, and domestic violence is the biggest risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Pregnant women who are IPV victims have high rates of stress, are more likely to smoke or use other drugs, deliver a preterm or low birthweight infant, have an increase in infectious complications, and are less likely to obtain prenatal care. </p>\n<p>However, a 2008 prospective cohort study (Audi et al.) with 1,229 participants found no statistically significant association between IPV perpetrated by partners and low birthweight or prematurity. </p>\n<p>Current NICE guidelines for antenatal care state that women should feel able to discuss sensitive issues and disclose problems. Clinicians should be alert to the symptoms and signs of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>A 2007 systematic review of the literature by Buck et al. identified that the three most commonly cited reasons why midwives did not ask about domestic abuse were lack of time, lack of training and inadequate resources. Raising awareness of the issue, improving basic education and increasing access to simple resources, such as leaflets giving details of where to get support, may provide midwives with the confidence to ask about domestic abuse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Psychiatric screening<br />Antenatal and postnatal depression have been shown to affect the cognitive and behavioural development of the child.  NICE guidelines recommend that two simple screening questions for depression should be asked on first contact with women in the antenatal and postnatal periods.</p>\n<p>The use of the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) tool was able to detect psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression in a 2006 RCT (Blackmore et al.). The authors concluded that this assessment may be particularly useful for raising and discussing sensitive issues; the detection of risk factors may also be improved by administering a simple standardised measure of depressive symptoms during routine antenatal care. However, there were no data to show that the assessment led to earlier interventions or had an effect on the incidence or outcome of postpartum <br />depression.</p>\n<p>In 2008, an Australian prospective cohort study by Milgrom et al.(40,333 participants) found that previous depression, current depression/anxiety and low partner support are key risk factors for postnatal depression, consistent with existing meta-analysis surveys. Current depression/anxiety (and to some extent social support) may be amenable to change and can therefore be targeted for intervention.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong> </p>\n<p>1. Audi, CA; Correa, AM; Latorre, Mdo R; Santiago, SM.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Medicines<p><strong>1.4 Medicines</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>It is important to understand the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy before considering the use of prescription/over-the-counter drugs or alternative medicines. Increased cardiovascular output, renal and endocrine function, reduced lung capacity and gastrointestinal motility, as well as changes in the drug-binding capacity of circulating proteins, have to be taken into account. Finally, many of the drugs used can pass the placental barrier and therefore reach the fetus.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Very few prescription or over-the counter drugs have been tested in clinical trials for use in pregnancy.  Most recommendations are based on case-control or anecdotal studies.  It is therefore essential for healthcare professionals to ensure the mother can make an informed decision.  Drugs should only be prescribed when the potential for benefitting the mother outweighs the potential for harming the fetus; they must also be well known and tested, and given in the smallest effective dose.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />A systematic review (Adab et al., 2004) looked at the use of common<br />antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy with regard to potential adverse effects on fetal neurodevelopmental outcomes.  Most studies failed to identify any significant detrimental outcomes with in utero exposure to monotherapy with carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbitone.  However, polytherapy was more commonly associated with poorer outcomes, as was exposure to any antiepileptic drugs when analysis did not take into account the type of drug.  The authors recommend treating pregnant women with monotherapy at the lowest possible dose to achieve seizure control. A recent study found that in pregnant women taking antiepileptic medication, supplementation of their diets with folic acid at 5-12 weeks decreases the risk of congenital abnormalities, but does not eliminate it (Kjaer et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br /> <br />A meta-analysis looking at the effects of paroxetine, an SSRI antidepressant drug, found that first trimester exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of fetal cardiac malformation (Bar-Oz et al., 2007). However, another recent study did not find any evidence that taking SSRI and TCA antidepressants increased the risk of congenital (including cardiac) malformations (Davis et al., 2007).  The same study found that taking antidepressant medication in the third trimester may increase the risk of perinatal complications, and when taken at any time during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm labour. Discontinuation of mood stabilising drugs during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus, but it has also been suggested that the harm to the mother may outweigh this (Viguera et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><br /> <br />Another systematic review investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin as a preventative treatment for pre-eclampsia.  Aspirin was associated with reduced pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality rates, as well as a reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth and an increase of 215 g in mean birthweight.  There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (Coomasaramy et al., 2003).</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Recently, a few RCTs have examined the use of alternative medicines and treatments during pregnancy:<br /><br />* Relaxation techniques and micronutrient supplements have been shown to be beneficial in pregnancy (Ahn et al., 2006; Bastani et al., 2005). However, analyses revealed no added benefit of multiple-micronutrient, compared with iron/folic acid supplementation (Haider and Bhutta, 2006).<br /><br />* A systematic review found that moxibustion may reduce the need for external cephalic version for breech presentation.  However, the authors could not make a recommendation due to an insufficient sample size (Coyle et al., 2007).<br /><br />* Acupuncture has been shown to relieve abdominal pain (Lund et al., 2006) and to reduce the use of paracetamol in pregnant women suffering from lower back pain (Guerreiro da Silva et al., 2003).  However, the numbers in these trials were small.  Another small RCT demonstrated that the use of acupuncture reduces the need for external cephalic version in breech presentation.<br /><br />* Acupressure over the volar aspect of the wrist at the P6 point does not result in a significant reduction in the amount of antiemetic medication, the requirement for intravenous fluid, or median duration of in-patient stay in women hospitalised for hyperemesis gravidarum  (Heazell et al., 2006). Low-level nerve stimulation therapy at the P6 point seems to have a beneficial effect in treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (Rosen et al., 2003). <br /><br />* Blue cohosh has been used by some as a labour-inducing aid. However, it should be used only with extreme caution as there have been reports of serious adverse outcomes (Dugoua et al., 2008).</p>\n<p><br />Women should not assume that complementary medicines are without adverse effects; very few have been established to be safe and effective when used in pregnancy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy<p><strong>2.2 Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p> <br />  <br />More than 80% of pregnant women experience nausea and 50% vomiting in the first trimester. The symptoms do not adversely affect the mother or fetus, but can have an impact on quality of life. Pregnant women should be advised that nausea and vomiting are usually normal and harmless symptoms, which resolve spontaneously by 16 to 20 weeks gestation. Hyperemesis gravidarum is excessive vomiting leading to a state of fluid and electrolyte imbalance; it has an incidence of 3.5/1000 deliveries. Symptomatic relief is available. Effective interventions are P6 acupressure, ginger and antihistamines. There is good evidence that antihistamines are safe in this context. Although one cohort study showed that vitamin B6 appeared safe, doubts about its safety still exist so it is not recommended (NICE guidance, 2008). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lacasse et al (2008) validated the “Health-Related Quality of Life for Nausea and Vomiting during Pregnancy\" (NVPQOL).  Their data suggested that the NVPQOL is a reliable and valid index to measure nausea and vomiting specific quality of life in the first trimester.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Ginger and Vitamin B6<br />A systematic review looked at six studies (total n=675) and confirmed that ginger improves both nausea and vomiting (Borelli et al., 2005). The review lacked large enough data sets to be able to confirm the safety of ginger. Another systematic review in 2005 <br />described doses of ginger up to 6g/day as safe, but recommended that it should only be administered in a clinical trial due to lack of good safety data (Betz et al., 2005). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two RCTs (n=291, n=138) compared vitamin B6 to ginger. Both RCTs concluded on the basis of weakly significant results that both ginger and vitamin B6 were equally effective in reducing nausea and vomiting. Safety data for neither ginger nor vitamin B6 were reported (Smith et al., 2004; Sripramote and Lekhyananda, 2003). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no new evidence on the safety of vitamin B6 in pharmacological doses, although a drug containing it, Benedictin (Debendox), was withdrawn in 1983 due to an apparent increase in limb abnormalities. Reviews of the studies reporting its teratogenicity do not support this fear.</p>\n<p><br />Acupuncture and Acupressure<br />A review was undertaken of acupuncture for nausea and vomiting of any cause, including chemotherapy, motion sickness and pregnancy: results were mixed for pregnancy, but the review highlights the growing evidence for the general efficacy of acupuncture point <br />stimulation (Streitberger et al., 2006). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A RCT (n=230) compared acupuncture point nerve stimulation to placebo for mild to severe first trimester nausea and vomiting. This is in contrast to most other studies which involved in-patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. The study showed significant reduction of symptoms measured by the Rhodes index (P=0.02) thereby promoting weight gain (P=0.003) (Rosen et al., 2003). </p>\n<p><br /> <br />A single-blind RCT (n=80) showed no reduction in anti-emetics required when acupressure was used (Heazell et al., 2006). Another single-blind study (n=66) showed no benefit of acupressure when compared to vitamin B6 (Jamigorn and Phupong, 2007).  A trial (n=88) compared a combined acupuncture and acupressure regime with antihistamine plus vitamin B12. The trial was not blinded or placebo controlled. The trial measured somatic and functional improvement, showing similar benefit for both (Neri et al., 2005). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A more recent small (n=75) Turkish RCT (Can Gürkan and Arslan, 2008) compared acupressure to placebo in women with nausea with and without vomiting who were unable to receive conventional treatments.  Over a 9 day period 26 women received P6 acupressure on days 4-6 while the placebo group (n =  24) received sham acupressure, and 25 women acted as a control group.  The P6 acupressure group reported improvements in frequency of nausea (P&lt;0.001), severity of nausea (P&lt;0.05) and intensity of discomfort felt from nausea (P&lt;0.001) during the treatment days when compared to the pre-treatment days 1-3.  However, the placebo group also reported an improvement in all areas (P&lt;0.05).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Steroids<br />Two small RCTs (n=40, n=80) agreed that corticosteroids improved symptoms (Bondok et al., 2006; Ziaei et al., 2004). A slightly larger RCT (n=126) did not use symptomatic improvement as an end point, but showed hospital readmission was not reduced by adding a corticosteroid to an antihistamine regime (Yost et al., 2003). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Helicobacter Pylori  <br />A recent systematic review (Golberg et al 2007) looked at the relationship between Helicobacter Pylori (H.Pylori) and hyperemesis gravidarum.  Fourteen case control studies were identified, involving 1732 participants and controls.  Ten studies showed a significant association and odds ratios varied from 0.55 to 109.33, three results were less than 1.  While an association between H.Pylori and hyperemesis gravidarum was suggested by this review, considerable heterogeneity in the studies involved highlights study limitations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 NKW References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Pregnancy after 41 weeks<p><strong>3.4 Pregnancy after 41 weeks</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is well recognized that perinatal morbidity and mortality are increased in pregnancies lasting more than 42 weeks. Therefore, it is recommended to induce labour in women with uncomplicated pregnancies after 41 weeks gestation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sweeping of the membranes<br />A 2006 RCT (de Miranda et al.) found in 742 low-risk women that repeated sweeping of the membranes reduced the risk of post-term pregnancy for both nulliparous and parous women. Adverse effects were similar in both groups except for uncomplicated bleeding, which was reported more frequently in the sweeping group. Other obstetric outcomes and indicators of neonatal morbidity were similar in both groups. There were two perinatal deaths in each group.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Induction of labour <br />In most centres, labour is induced by intra-vaginal application of a prostaglandin-containing gel. The current gold standard is vaginal dinoprostone, which has been shown to reduce perinatal death and the rate of Caesarean section, while the frequency of instrumental deliveries remained unchanged. </p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane systematic review (Alfirevic and Weeks) assessed the safety and efficacy of oral misoprostol for the induction of labour. The review included 41 trials and 8606 women. In four trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (474 participants), labouring time, the need for oxytocin and the Caesarean section rate (intact membranes) were reduced in the oral misoprostol group. In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone (2627 participants), uterine hyperstimulation was more common in women taking oral misoprostol, although this was not associated with any adverse fetal events. In the seven trials that compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin (1017 participants), the only difference between the groups was an increase in meconium-stained liquor in women with ruptured membranes following administration of oral misoprostol. Sixteen trials compared oral and vaginal misoprostol (3645 participants) and found no difference in the primary outcomes. There was less uterine hyperstimulation in those given oral misoprostol. The review concluded that oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo and at least as effective as vaginal dinoprostone. However, there remain questions regarding its safety due to a relatively high rate of uterine hyperstimulation and lack of dose ranging studies. Therefore, despite being cheap, stable at room temperature and effective in causing uterine contractions, oral misoprostol has not been licensed for use in pregnancy in most countries.  Reports of uterine rupture in women with previous caesarean sections mean that it remains contraindicated in this group.</p>\n<p>Two RCTs comparing oral versus vaginal misoprostol for the induction of labour have been reported since this systematic review was published. In 2007 Rasheed et al. concluded that the vaginal was more efficacious than the oral route by requiring fewer doses and having a reduced need for oxytocin (310 participants). However, vaginal was associated with an increased incidence of hyperstimulation. In 2008 Cheng et al. compared titrated oral with vaginal misoprostol (207 participants). A higher proportion of the women receiving titrated oral misoprostol had a vaginal delivery within 12 hrs (74.3%) compared to the other group (25.5%). The incidence of hyperstimulation was 0.0% in the titrated oral group compared with 11.3% in the vaginal group (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.61)</p>\n<p>In 2007 Nasser et al. compared patient satisfaction with oral versus vaginal misoprostol in a randomised trial of 170 participants. Sublingual misoprostol was associated with a higher patient satisfaction rate compared to a similar dose of vaginal misoprostol. Sublingual misoprostol was associated with less pain at pelvic examinations, a better than expected labour experience, a positive attitude to induction in subsequent pregnancies and a preference for the same route in subsequent pregnancies. The mean number of doses, oxytocin augmentation, uterine hyperstimulation, induction to delivery interval and Caesarean section rates were similar between the two groups.</p>\n<p>The safety and efficacy of intra-vaginal misoprostol have been compared to dinoprostone in two recent RCTs (Calder et al. and Prager et al.). Misoprostol is cheaper and easier to store than dinoprostone but its use for induction of labour is not licensed.  The latest NICE guidelines on induction of labour advise that misoprostol should only be offered as a method of inducing labour in women who have had an intrauterine fetal death or in the context of a clinical trial.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Provision of antenatal care<p><strong>3.1 Provision of antenatal care</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How, and by whom, should antenatal care be provided?<br />Antenatal care in uncomplicated pregnancies should be midwife and GP-led. There should be continuity of care throughout the antenatal period from a small group of carers with whom the woman feels comfortable. A clear system of referral paths should be established. The care should be sensitive to the needs of individual women and the local community. </p>\n<p>Structured maternity records should be used for antenatal care and systems should be in place to ensure that women carry their own case notes (Cochrane Systematic Review 2004). Nulliparous women with an uncomplicated pregnancy should have ten appointments during their antenatal care schedule, parous women should have seven. A standardised national maternal record with an agreed minimum data set should be developed and used.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Support during the antenatal period<br />A randomised trial in Sweden with 1,700 participants (Berglund et al.) concluded in 2007 that psychosocial support and risk assessment in early pregnancy are improved by combining the perspectives of midwives and doctors: 758 mothers had a routine early pregnancy risk assessment by a doctor and 942 women had a planning conference between a midwife and doctor. The degree of agreement in risk registration between the two groups was found to be good for previous pregnancy complications and recommendations for a doctor’s consultation; fair for social problems, and poor for registration of symptoms and problems in the index pregnancy, including psychosocial aspects such as anxiety. </p>\n<p>A 2008 RCT with 68 participants in Thailand (Jareethum et al.) compared the satisfaction levels of antenatal care between healthy pregnant women who received short message service (SMS) via mobile phone for prenatal support, and those who did not. In the SMS using group, the confidence level was higher (p = 0.001) and the anxiety level was lower (p = 0.002) than the control group in the antenatal period; however, no difference in pregnancy outcomes were found.</p>\n<p>A 2006 RCT with 540 participants in Sweden (Ekstrom et al.) reported that mothers were more satisfied with emotional and information support after implementation of a process-oriented, breastfeeding training program for antenatal midwives and postnatal nurses that focused on providing continuity of care. The results lend support to health care professionals making every effort to have one face-to-face encounter to discuss breastfeeding with expectant mothers. </p>\n<p>In 2007 an RCT with 131 participants (Barlow et al.) reported that pregnant women in families at risk of abuse and neglect benefit from a weekly home visiting service from 6 months gestation to 12 months after delivery; statistically significant improvements were reported in maternal sensitivity and infant cooperativeness. </p>\n<p>An RCT with 117 women in 2003 (Cope et al.) reported that provision of additional material (particularly an audiotape) following a prenatal scan appears to minimise anxiety compared with standard practice. Participants with suspected fetal anomalies were randomised to four groups: one was given a consultation and ultrasound report; the other three groups had this standard information and either audiotapes and/or a non-technical letter. Patient recall of the consultation was not altered by these extra interventions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1. Jareethum R, Titapant V, Chantra T, Sommai V, Chuenwattana P, Jirawan C.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Provision of information and antenatal education<p><strong>1.1 Provision of information and antenatal education</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Good communication between the healthcare professional and the pregnant woman is extremely important – it should be supplemented with appropriate and accessible written material.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women should be able to make an informed decision regarding all aspects of their antenatal care. In other words, women’s choice should be an integral part of the medical decision-making process. This is obviously important for research trials, especially in critical situations.  Kenyon et al. (2006) investigated women’s experiences of being recruited into a large multicenter RCT of antibiotics in pre-term labour. Most women were satisfied with the written and oral information provided by their health care professionals. However, it appeared that the stressful nature of the situation did decrease the women’s ability to understand the information fully, in particular trial design and practices. For example, many women believed that antibiotics were absolutely safe. The main motivation for trial participation was the possibility of an improved outcome for the baby.  The authors suggested further research on how governance arrangements for trials can protect participating women and suggested investigating the interaction between research candidates and recruiters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Antenatal education in the UK is mostly delivered individually by midwives and GPs, and in groups within antenatal classes. The authors state that the effects of general antenatal education for childbirth and/or parenthood remain unknown. A recent systematic review looked at the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. The authors found one RCT, which examined an educational intervention to increase vaginal birth after Caesarean section. Individual antenatal education did not increase the number of vaginal births after Caesarean section compared to routine information (Gagnon, 2006). However, a recent RCT demonstrated that a computer based decision aid for the mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section did increase vaginal delivery rates (Montgomery et al., 2007). A recent Cochrane review of RCTs found that the effects of structured group or individual antenatal classes are largely unknown due to a lack of studies (Gagnon et al., 2008). There is little evidence that antenatal class attendance changes birth outcomes e.g. mode of birth; however, parental knowledge is increased and most women view antenatal classes positively. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A decision aid for women with breech presentation at term resulted in increased knowledge and satisfaction, reduced decisional conflict, and no increase in anxiety compared to usual care (Nassar et al., 2007). Evidence shows that pregnant women undergoing prenatal testing for Down’s Syndrome perceive the risks of having an affected child and the risks of the diagnostic procedures, depending on their prenatal diagnostic test inclination, rather than the actual risks involved (Caughey et al., 2008). Clearly, effectively educating parents and communicating the actual risk is essential so that they can make informed decisions. Information leaflets are effective in increasing the knowledge of pregnant women about screening tests, as are decision aid techniques, although more information may decrease the uptake rate. Women have been found to prefer to receive information face-to-face rather than in other ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Antenatal education has been demonstrated to help  cessation of smoking during pregnancy (Dornelas et al., 2006; Lumley et al., 2004) and to improve breastfeeding practice (Mattar et al., 2007),initiation and duration of breast feeding.. Compared with routine hospital care, one RCT showed that there is a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding if pregnant women have antenatal or postnatal education (Lin-Lin Su et al. 2008). On the other hand, another RCT found that additional breast feeding education mid-trimester could not be recommended as an effective strategy to increase breastfeeding initiation or duration compared with standard care in settings where breastfeeding initiation is already high (Forster et al., 2004). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One Australian cross sectional study found that prenatal information regarding Listeria was insufficient. Lower income, lower education, non-English speaking and unplanned pregnancy were associated with decreased knowledge of Listeria and increased consumption of high risk foods (Bondarianzadeh et al., 2007). There is also evidence that antenatal education regarding diet is effective in improving eating behaviours, although this is not linked with an improvement in pregnancy outcome. Providing information on safe alcohol consumption in pregnancy does not appear to alter practice, but it does improve knowledge about recommended safe levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 <strong>AEU </strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

Isometric calf exercises, walking around the cabin and avoiding dehydration are also important considerations. It is recommended not to travel by air after the 36th week of pregnancy, and indeed most airlines will refuse to carry women whose pregnancy is past this date – after the 28th week women should carry a letter from their doctor or midwife, confirming good health, normal pregnancy and the expected delivery date.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a car, it is important that the three-point seat belt should be used correctly: it should be worn above and below the abdomen, never across it.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal Care - Ultrasound assessment in the third trimester<p><strong>4.3 Ultrasound assessment in the third trimester</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultrasound is a very useful diagnostic tool in obstetrics but it may carry small risks for the fetus. </p>\n<p><br />In 2005 Bly et al. conducted a literature review to determine the balance of benefits, harms and costs of ultrasound during pregnancy. The review recommended that ultrasound should be used sparingly and carefully due to the potential for tissue heating, which may cause tissue damage. Circumstances in which tissue heating was more likely or more dangerous were reported to be: scanning during the first trimester with a long trans-vesical path; bone being in the focal zone, and scanning poorly-perfused and embryonic tissues, and scanning febrile mothers. The higher energy forms of ultrasound, in particular Doppler ultrasound, were recommended to be avoided completely in the first trimester, and not to be used more than medical advice dictates.</p>\n<p><br />Routine third trimester ultrasound<br />A routine third trimester ultrasound scan is currently not offered in low-risk pregnancies. This practice is based mainly on results of a Cochrane meta-analysis published in 2001 which concluded that \"routine late pregnancy ultrasound in low-risk or unselected populations does not confer benefit on mother or baby”. However, in a 2008 Le Ray et al. pointed out that the meta analysis included trials of outdated techniques and ultrasound examinations performed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and that none of the trials evaluated the effect of third trimester scanning on perinatal outcome when ultrasound resulted in an altered perinatal management plan. Their assessment of the evidence called into question the contemporary validity of the conclusion of the meta analysis’ conclusions and it has recently been withdrawn by the authors. <br /></p>\n<p>Ultrasound diagnosis of placenta praevia<br />If a routine ultrasound offered in the second trimester reveals the placenta to be low lying,  a further ultrasound should be performed in the third trimester. If the placenta is in a normal position in the second trimester, there is no evidence that ultrasound scanning in the third trimester improves the outcome for mother or baby. <br />A Canadian review of trans-vaginal ultrasound for the diagnosis of placenta praevia (Oppenheimer, 2007) advised that if the placental edge reaches, or overlaps with the internal os between 18 and 24 weeks gestation, a follow-up ultrasound in the third trimester should be performed. The latest NICE Antenatal Care Guidelines (March 2008) recommend the repeat scan to be at 32 weeks. The review by Oppenheimer also noted the greater accuracy of trans-vaginal compared with trans-abdominal ultrasound.  </p>\n<p><br />Ultrasound measurement of cervical length<br />There is a known relationship between cervical shortening and pre-term birth. <br />A randomized, prospective, longitudinal study by Hebbar and Samjhana in 2006 (200 participants) showed that the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery increases steeply as cervical length decreases, and that cervical length determined by ultrasound in mid-trimester has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of 77%, 95%, 56% and 98% respectively, at a cut off value of =2.5cm.<br />A 2004 RCT  (Tsoi et al. 253 participants) concluded that ultrasound measurement of cervical length helps to avoid over-diagnosis of preterm labour in women with preterm contractions and intact membranes. A cervical length of 15mm was found to be useful in predicting who would go into labour within the next 7 days.<br />Ultrasound and maternal-fetal bonding<br />A small randomised study in 2005 (Rustico et al.) allocated 100 women to two groups, one of which received 2D and the other 4D ultrasound.

The clinical features and diagnosis of endometriosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>No new evidence was identified by our updated literature search on this topic. The information below is reproduced from our AEU in 2007.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following symptoms have been associated with endometriosis:</p>\n<p>• Severe dysmenorrhoea (painful periods)<br />• Deep dyspareunia (pain on intercourse)<br />• Chronic non-menstrual pain<br />• Pain at the time of ovulation<br />• Dyschezia (pain on defaecation, especially at the time of menstruation)<br />• Cyclical or perimenstrual symptoms, affecting the bowel or bladder, with or without abnormal bleeding or pain<br />• Subfertility (difficulty conceiving for more 12 months)<br />• Chronic fatigue</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the predictive value of any one symptom or set of symptoms is uncertain because of the overlap with other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal disorders (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006.). The difficulties inherent in interpreting such symptoms contribute to the well-recognised delay of up to 10 years between the onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who present with such symptoms, especially if there is a cyclical component.  A history and pelvic examination should be performed. There is evidence to suggest that performing the examination during menstruation helps to make the diagnosis, although many women are reluctant to be examined at that time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The pelvic examination may be entirely normal, but features suggestive of endometriosis include:</p>\n<p>• Generalised pelvic tenderness <br />• Fixed, retroverted uterus (due to adhesions and/or deeply infiltrating disease) <br />• Tender uterosacral ligaments (nodules may also be palpable) <br />• Enlarged ovaries<br />• Seeing lesions/nodules in the vagina or on the cervix</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds but it can only be confirmed on visual inspection of the peritoneal cavity at laparoscopy.  Histological confirmation of at least one lesion represents ideal practice, although if an endometrioma &gt; 4 cms in diameter or deeply infiltrating disease is present, histology <strong>should be obtained</strong> to exclude rare instances of malignancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disease severity should be assessed by documenting in detail the type, location and extent of all lesions and adhesions found at surgery.  Ideal practice is to record the findings on video or DVD as well. Disease severity can be assessed quantitatively using a classification system such as the one developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  However, there is no correlation between such systems and the type or severity of pain symptoms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with an approximately 3% risk of minor complications, such as nausea or shoulder-tip pain, and a risk of major complications, such as bowel perforation, of between 0.6 to 1.8 per 1,000 procedures. Therefore, a non-invasive test would be clinically useful. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following tests have been used with varying degrees of success:</p>\n<p>• Serum CA-125 (a test for ovarian cancer) – levels may be elevated in endometriosis but the test has little diagnostic value and is not recommended.<br />• Trans-vaginal ultrasound – a useful tool to make and exclude the diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma, but it has limited value in diagnosing peritoneal disease.<br />• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – there is insufficient evidence at present regarding its diagnostic potential; however, MRI and other imaging modalities (e.g. transrectal ultrasound, IVP, barium enema) may have a role in defining disease extent in deeply infiltrating endometriosis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a woman with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis wants treatment without a definitive diagnosis, the options include counselling, analgesia and hormonal medication to reduce menstrual flow (e.g. progestagens or COC). It is unclear whether the COC should be taken conventionally, continuously or in a tricycle regimen in such circumstances.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist may be taken, although this is an expensive option and concerns exist about the effects on bone mineral density (BMD). It is also argued that establishing the correct diagnosis at laparoscopy before initiating therapy with significant short- and long-term side effects is the preferred approach (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2007 AEU References</strong><strong><br /></strong>The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2006). Treatment of pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.

These finding were underlined by a recent systematic review on the effects of danazol, gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, combined oral contraceptive pills and GnRH analogues on subsequent fertility. No evidence of a benefit of ovarian suppression was found in women with subfertility and endometriosis of all stages (Hughes et al., 2007).<br />• More harm than good may result from such treatment because of side-effects and the lost opportunity to conceive.<br />• There is no evidence that hormonal medication is effective in more severe disease.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Surgery for endometriosis-associated subfertility</strong></p>\n<p>• Ablation of endometriotic lesions plus adhesiolysis to improve fertility in minimal-mild endometriosis is effective compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. The recommendation is based upon a systematic review and meta-analysis of two similar, but contradictory RCTs. The combined data showed that surgery was beneficial for ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05, 2.57). The number needed to treat is 12 (95% CI 7, 49), i.e. for every 12 women with minimal-mild disease diagnosed at laparoscopy, there will be one additional pregnancy if lesions are ablated at the time, compared to not treating them.<br />• Postoperative hormonal treatment does not have a beneficial effect on pregnancy rates.  <br />• The role of surgery in improving pregnancy rates for moderate-severe disease is uncertain.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>In vitro fertilisation (IVF) for endometriosis-associated subfertility</strong></p>\n<p>• IVF is appropriate treatment, especially if tubal function is compromised, if there is also male factor infertility, and/or other treatments have failed.<br />• A meta-analysis of published studies suggests IVF pregnancy rates are lower in endometriosis than in tubal infertility, but these results are not seen in large databases.<br />• A Cochrane review suggests that treatment with a GnRH agonist for 3-6 months before IVF increases the rate of clinical pregnancy in endometriosis-associated subfertility; however, the conclusion is based on one small RCT and therefore support for this strategy is not unanimous (ASRM Practice Committee - Infertility, 2006).<br />• A recent small RCT looked at implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in patients undergoing ICSI treatment with mild to moderate endometriosis and endometrioma. They could not find significant differences if patients were on an GnRH antagonist (cetorelix) or GnRH agonist (triptrolein) protocol although there was a trend towards higher rates when when receiving the latter (Pabucca et al., 2007).<br />• Ovarian endometriomas are believed to affect IVF pregnancy rates adversely. The RCOG Guideline therefore recommends that laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy should be performed before IVF if an endometrioma =4cm in diameter. However, in a recent meta-analysis, the odds for clinical pregnancy were not significantly reduced in women with an endometrioma compared to controls; overall odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.63, 1.81) (Gupta et. al., 2006). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong><br />Pabuccu, R., Onalan, G., Kaya, C.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Epidemiology and aetiology<p><strong>3. Epidemiology and aetiology of endometriosis</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is difficult to define the epidemiology of endometriosis precisely because a surgical procedure is required to make the diagnosis definitively. However, the following are best estimates: </p>\n<p>• Endometriosis affects 10-15% of all women in the reproductive years<br />• The incidence is 40-60% in women with dysmenorrhoea and 20-30% in those with subfertility.<br />• Risk factors include a heavy menstrual load (due to short cycle length and long duration of flow).<br />• Current/recent use of the combined oral contraceptive (COC), smoking and exercise may be protective.<br />• The sisters and daughters of affected women are 6-9 times more likely to develop endometriosis than women in the general population.<br />• Endometriosis is a considerable burden in terms of both direct and indirect healthcare costs, and its affect on quality of life (Gao et. al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the aetiology of endometriosis. The most dominant theory is retrograde menstruation (the passage of viable endometrial cells along the fallopian tubes into the pelvis at the time of menstruation).</p>\n<p>• However, retrograde menstruation occurs commonly in all women. <br />A recent systematic review found evidence supporting the retrograde menstruation theory. A significantly higher prevalence of endometriotic lesions was found in the right subphrenic area.  The authors explain this by the fact that peritoneal fluid which is transported clockwise is trapped in the right hypochondrium by the falciform ligament (Vercellini et al., 2007).<br />• It is likely that aberrant function in related pathophysiological systems (e.g. immunity, cell clearance, angiogenesis) is responsible for the implantation and subsequent growth of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. <br />• The disease causes chronic inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cyst formation.<br />• Endometriosis has been associated in the past with various malignancies (e.g. ovarian cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). However, the data are inconclusive and the risks, if they exist, may not be clinically relevant (Somigliana et al., 2006). Another recent systematic review however, looked at causality versus bias for interpreting data demonstrating an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. They concluded that a causal relationship exists. However, the frequency of malignant transformation of endometriotic lesions into ovarian cancer is similar to that of eutopic endometrium (Vigano et al., 2007).<br />• A recent systematic review of the effect of food intake on endometriosis and dysmenorrhea revealed that there are no clear data supporting dietary recommendations. Some studies suggested that fish oil (n-3 oils) may reduce pain symptoms in endometriosis. The authors suggested further studies on that matter (Fjerbaek and Knudsen, 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Fjerbaek, A., Knudsen, U.B.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Non-surgical management<p><strong>6. Non-surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis can be a chronic and debilitating disease, and few treatment options are entirely satisfactory. A cure may be achievable but for many women the medical and surgical treatments currently available have their limitations and symptoms often return after treatment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some women prefer not to take hormonal medication and are able to control their symptoms with analgesics. Although non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may relieve endometriosis-associated pain, there is too little evidence to assess their effectiveness. NSAIDs have significant side-effects (e.g. gastric ulceration and an anti-ovulatory effect when taken at mid-cycle). Other analgesics may be effective but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is some evidence that high frequency TENS, acupuncture, vitamin B1 and magnesium may help to relieve dysmenorrhoea, but it is not known whether such treatments are effective in endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhoea.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women may rely on complementary medicine approaches (e.g. homeopathy, reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbal treatments). There is no evidence from RCTs to support the use of these therapies in endometriosis but it is generally recommended that they should not be ruled out if the woman feels that they could be beneficial to her overall pain management and/or quality of life, or work in conjunction with more traditional therapies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A recent systematic review of clinical and experimental data on the use of medicinal herbs in the treatment of endometriosis illustrated the lack of evidence from clinical studies (Wieser et al., 2007). However, the review highlighted the anti-inflammatory and pain-alleviating mechanisms of action of many herbal remedies and predicted that they might have a beneficial effect in endometriosis symptoms, if tested in an appropriate manner. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The options for hormonal treatment include the COC, progestagens, androgenic drugs and GnRH agonists; at appropriate doses, all suppress ovarian activity and menstruation. The levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS) also reduces endometriosis-associated pain (ESHRE 2007), and there are pilot data indicating that the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, may be effective although it is associated with significant bone mineral density (BMD) loss. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The principal hormonal drugs studied - COCs, danazol, gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and GnRH agonists – are equally effective at relieving endometriosis-associated pain when prescribed for 6 months but their side-effect and cost profiles differ. It is also important to bear in mind that:<br />• medical treatment does not always provide complete pain relief and some patients fail to respond at all. <br />• symptom recurrence is common following medical treatment. <br />• some side-effects limit long-term use and may produce poor compliance, e.g. androgenic side-effects associated with danazol (Selak et al., 2007). GnRH agonist therapy may result in up to 6% BMD loss in the first 6 months and the loss may not always be entirely reversible. However, the concomitant use of ‘add-back’ (oestrogen and progestagen) therapy protects against BMD loss at the lumbar spine during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment.<br />• the COC and Depo-Provera can be used long term, but danazol and GnRH agonists are usually restricted to 6 months; however, one study suggests 3 months with a GnRH agonist may be as effective as 6 months in terms of pain relief.<br />• although the COC and GnRH agonist therapy appear to be equally effective, the published studies are all small and no other treatments have been assessed as comparators (Davis et al., 2007). Therefore, there is a clear need to evaluate fully the role of the COC in managing symptoms associated with endometriosis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is unclear whether hormonal treatment causes atrophy of endometriotic lesions, especially as the natural history of the untreated disease is unknown. The available data suggest that MPA and luteal phase dydrogesterone are ineffective, whereas gestrinone may be effective. The effects of danazol and the GnRH agonist, triptorelin, are inconclusive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong>  <br />Davis, L., Kennedy, S., Moore, J., Prentice, A.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Surgical management<p><strong>7. Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surgery involves the excision/ablation of endometriotic lesions plus adhesiolysis. The surgery is either conservative (i.e. the uterus and ovaries are preserved) or radical (i.e. the uterus and ovaries are removed), and it is preferably performed laparoscopically. However, no RCTs have evaluated the different surgical techniques available. </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Conservative surgery<br /></strong>The results of two RCTs indicate that ablation of endometriotic lesions reduces endometriosis-associated pain compared to diagnostic laparoscopy.<br /> <br />• The first RCT compared laser ablation of minimal-moderate disease plus laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA) versus diagnostic laparoscopy alone for pain relief. At 6 months’ follow-up, 63% of treated patients reported symptom improvement or resolution compared to 23% in the no-treatment group. Outcome was poorest in patients with minimal endometriosis. <br />• In the second RCT, women with all disease stages were randomised to a diagnostic procedure or excisional surgery initially, followed 6 months later by a repeat laparoscopy at which any endometriosis present was treated. Significantly more women (80% versus 32%) reported symptomatic improvement after initial excisional surgery than after placebo. At 12 months’ follow-up, both groups reported a significant reduction in all pain parameters, except dyschezia, compared to assessment at 6 months. <br />• It has subsequently become clear that there is no need to perform LUNA when ablating endometriotic lesions and LUNA by itself has no effect on dysmenorrhoea associated with endometriosis.<br /> <br />The management of severe and deeply infiltrating endometriosis is complex. Surgery is usually required and multiple organs are sometimes involved. Therefore, if disease of such severity is suspected or diagnosed, referral to a centre with the necessary expertise to offer all available treatments in a multidisciplinary context, including advanced laparoscopic surgery and laparotomy, is strongly recommended.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Radical surgery<br /></strong>Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is generally reserved for women with debilitating symptoms attributed to endometriosis who have completed childbearing and in whom other therapies have failed. If a hysterectomy is performed, all visible endometriotic tissue should be removed at the same time. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may result in improved pain relief and a reduced chance of future surgery.<br /> <br />Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended after radical surgery in young women given the overall health benefits, but there is controversy regarding the ideal regimen.<br /> <br /><strong>Unopposed oestrogen</strong><br />• Advantages – standard treatment after hysterectomy as there is no need for endometrial protection<br />• Disadvantages – residual endometriosis may be reactivated or transformed into malignant tissue<br /> <br /><strong>Oestrogen plus a progestagen<br /></strong>• Advantages – may protect against unopposed action of oestrogen on residual endometriosis<br />• Disadvantages – increase in breast cancer risk associated with combined oestrogen and progestagen HRT and tibolone.<br /> <br />The RCOG Guideline states ‘The ideal regimen for HRT after bilateral oophorectomy is unclear and should be discussed on an individual basis’, whereas the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Practice Committee Report states ‘Continuous combined oestrogen-progestagen therapy is the recommended regimen for treating menopausal symptoms in women with endometriosis, an exception to the usual recommendation for oestrogen only treatment after hysterectomy’.<br /> <br />Role of medical treatment as an adjunct to surgery<br />• There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify the use of preoperative or postoperative hormonal treatment.<br />• In a small RCT, the LNG-IUS, inserted after laparoscopic surgery, significantly reduced the risk of recurrent moderate-severe dysmenorrhoea at one year follow-up.<br />• The results of one RCT indicate that immunomodulation with pentoxifylline after laparoscopic surgery is of no benefit.<br />• Hormonal suppression (with a COC or GnRH agonist) or dietary therapy (with vitamins, minerals salts, lactic ferments, fish oil) after surgery for Stage III-IV endometriosis are more effective than surgery plus placebo in terms of obtaining pain relief and improving quality of life  (Sesti et al., 2007).<br /><br /><strong>Anti-adhesion therapy<br /></strong>• There is evidence from one small RCT that Oxiplex/AP gel may be effective in reducing adhesions after laparoscopic surgery for Stage I-III endometriosis, compared to surgery alone (diZerega et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References<br /></strong>Sesti, F., Pietropolli, A., Capozzolo, T., Broccoli, P., Pierangeli, S., Bollea, MR., Piccione, E.

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women<p><strong>2. Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Anna Jeffery-Smith and Charles Williams</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Definition of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)</em></p>\n<p>HMB is highly subjective and current objective measures of HMB are not practical in clinical settings. There is also natural variability in menstrual cycle length, duration of menstruation and blood loss within the population.</p>\n<p>HMB should be defined as excessive menstrual loss which interferes with the woman’s physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms. Any interventions should aim to improve quality of life measures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of HMB</em></p>\n<p>The prevalence of HMB has been studied in a number of countries and clinical settings through a variety of objective and subjective measures, resulting in a wide range of estimates. </p>\n<p>Studies have suggested that approximately 10% of reproductive aged women have objective evidence of HMB; using subjective measures (self-reported information), the figure is approximately 30% (Lui et al., 2007).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Risk Factors for increased menstrual bleeding</em></p>\n<p>Multiple factors, including increasing age, presence of uterine fibroids and racial group have been associated with an increased risk of HMB. However, their role in causality and the effects of modifying them remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>Psychological and sociocultural factors can influence a woman’s response to menstrual blood loss, and thus must be evaluated during the consultation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of uterine pathology</em></p>\n<p>The majority of women have no uterine pathology as the cause of their HMB. </p>\n<p>The most commonly found pathologies are uterine fibroids (approximately 30% of women) and polyps (approximately 10% of women).</p>\n<p>Pre-malignant and malignant pathology are rare in women presenting with HMB who have undergone investigations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Impact of HMB on quality of life</em></p>\n<p>It is important to recognise the major impact that HMB has on a woman’s health related quality of life (HRQoL). Evidence suggests that HMB impacts on social interaction and is associated with higher unemployment and absence from work, although it may not to be perceived by women to affect work performance. Interventions should focus on improving quality of life as opposed to focusing on menstrual blood loss.</p>\n<p>There is at present no specific HRQoL measure for HMB. Previous evidence suggests that current HRQoL measures, including Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), are not specific enough to reflect all of the HRQoL issues facing women with HMB. HMB specific quality of life measures need to be developed. </p>\n<p>A recent systematic review evaluated the evidence relating to HRQoL as well as health care costs. SF-36 scores from eight RCTs were included in a meta-analysis. Results suggested that women with abnormal uterine bleeding have HRQoL below  the 25th percentile for the general female population. Most significantly affected areas of life were physical and emotional functioning affecting work productivity and other daily activities (Lui et al., 2007)</p>\n<p>Sixteen studies using other validated HRQoL instruments found abnormal uterine bleeding to be associated with psychological morbidity, diminished sexual functioning and adverse effects on social, professional and family life (Lui et al., 2007).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Liu ZD; Doan QV; Blumenthal P; Dubois RW.

Methodology</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>The aim of the literature search for the 2008 national knowledge week was to update the original search carried out in 2007. Search strategies devised last year, based on those used by NICE, were re-run and the databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, OVID Medline, Pubmed and OVID Embase. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted. The search terms used included menorrhagia; hypermenorrhoea; menometrorrhagia; metromenorrhagia; menstrual bleed; heavy periods; heavy menses; menstruation; heavy blood loss; dysfunctional uterine bleeding. These were combined with terms to filter for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs and the limits ‘English in language’ and restricted to May 2007 to April 2008.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of the 153 papers identified were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. After sifting, 21 papers were identified as being relevant and were included in this update. Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following summary documents are based on the existing NICE guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited. Readers are referred to the NICE guideline for the citation details of the older studies.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/Page.aspx?pagename=08HMBNKWC\"><strong>Link back to AEU Contents Page</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12008 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Treatment (surgical and non-surgical)<p><strong>5. Treatment: surgical and non-surgical</strong></p>\n<p>Anna Jeffery-Smith and Charles Williams</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The range of treatments available for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is considerable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Medical Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>The NICE guideline outlines the order in which pharmaceutical treatments should be considered. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(1) Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) (for at least 12 months). This leads to a highly significant decrease in menstrual blood loss (MBL), but its acceptability is limited by the high incidence of irregular bleeding and spotting that can persist for many months, as well as progestagenic side effects and persistent abdominal pain. Therefore, women should be advised to persevere with treatment for at least 6 cycles in order to see a benefit. Insertion of the LNG-IUS is easier in multiparous women although data do not suggest that side effects are more common in those who have not been pregnant. Oral treatment can be commenced whilst waiting for the device to be inserted. </p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />A recent cost-utility study found that the most cost-effective treatment for HMB was the LNG-IUS, followed by ablation surgery as required (Clegg et al., 2007).<br />In comparison with thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA), LNG-IUS was more effective at reducing MBL at 12 months, but had a slower onset of effect and was less tolerated because of side effects and continuing bleeding in a small proportion of patients (Shaw et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(2) Tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (taken during menses). These lead to a decrease of up to 50% in MBL. Mefenamic acid is also useful in treating dysmenorrhoea. They are very safe and need only be taken for a few days each month. However, they should be stopped if there is no benefit after 3 cycles. The combined oral contraceptive pill is also an acceptable alternative. </p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />A recent Cochrane review indicated that whilst NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in treating HMB, they were not as effective as tranexamic acid, the LNG-IUS or danazol. NSAIDs are very well tolerated with no more adverse effects than placebo. Most trials have looked at the effects of mefenamic acid, but naproxen has been shown to be as effective albeit with increased gastrointestinal side effects (Lethaby et al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(3) Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or injected long acting progestagens (for at least 3 months). </p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />A recent Cochrane review showed a significant decrease in MBL with a 21 day course of norethisterone. The decrease was significantly less than found with LNG-IUS; however, there were also fewer unpleasant side effects such as intermenstrual bleeding and breast tenderness.  The long course of progestagens has yet to be compared with other medical therapies. The review confirmed that there was no place for oral progestagens given in the luteal phase only: they are significantly less effective at reducing MBL than tranexamic acid, danazol and the LNG-IUS (Lethaby et al, 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Danazol</em> <br />The NICE guideline states that danazol should not be routinely used to treat HMB. </p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />A Cochrane review found danazol to be effective in reducing MBL when compared with other available medical therapies (although it has never been compared with the LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid). It reported more adverse effects than the other drugs, particularly weight gain, acne, hirsutism and musculoskeletal pains, although this did not seem to affect its acceptability. Danazol has teratogenic effects, so women must be advised about the need for effective contraception. As yet, there is not enough evidence to recommend danazol as a treatment for HMB (Beaumont et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a)<br /></em>These are recommended prior to surgery for fibroids, or when other treatments for fibroids are contraindicated. If used for more than six months or if adverse effects are experienced (e.g. vasomotor symptoms), HRT ‘add-back’ therapy (e.g. tibolone) should be prescribed.</p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />Add-back HRT - either started immediately or three months into GnRH-a treatment -has been shown in an RCT to reduce the fall in bone mineral density and vasomotor symptoms associated with GnRH-a without diminishing the effect on fibroid size. Patients taking tibolone reported a higher rate of vaginal bleeding than patients taking GnRH-a alone, but this is thought to be less than that experienced before treatment (Morris et al., 2008).</p>\n<p>The choice of treatment depends on a number of factors, particularly the woman’s desire to conceive. A second pharmacological treatment can be considered where a first has failed rather than immediate referral to surgery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Surgical Treatment</strong></em></p>\n<p>Four surgical options are recommended in the NICE guideline:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Endometrial Ablation</em> <br />This is recommended where no pathology is found, or where there are only small fibroids. It is not suitable if a woman wants to become pregnant in the future; women should be advised to avoid pregnancy and to use appropriate contraception.  Commonly used methods include microwave endometrial ablation (MEA), thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA) and bipolar endometrial ablation. All methods have been subject to close scrutiny by the Health Technology Authority (HTA). </p>\n<p>TBEA has recently been compared to the Cavertherm thermal balloon and both were found to be equally effective (Brun et al., 2006). Ablation is probably less cost effective than the LNG-IUS although patients liked avoiding long term therapy (Brown et al., 2006). It can also be performed successfully as an outpatient (Marsh et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />A recent systematic review found TBEA to be an effective alternative treatment for menorrhagia resulting in reduced MBL and high satisfaction rates (Iavazzo et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>In a comparison with the LNG-IUS, both methods demonstrated a reduction in MBL recorded by pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) and the number of days of bleeding at 12 months.  The LNG-IUS had more of an effect than TBEA, but TBEA’s onset of effect was faster (Shaw et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>In an RCT comparing endometrial ablation and hysterectomy, both were effective at 24 months in solving the problem that led women to seek care (85% compared with 94%), and in relieving bleeding, pain, fatigue and other symptoms.  Hysterectomy was more effective at reducing bleeding, but associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and six times the infection rate of ablation. The re-operation risk at 5 years was 31% for the ablation group. (Dickersin et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A recent study comparing endometrial ablation in women with bleeding disorders found a significant reduction in MBL and no difference in the proportion of complications compared to controls. The advantage of this method over hysterectomy for women with bleeding disorders is to reduce the complication rate to that of the general population (El Nashar et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 5 year follow-up comparing TBEA and bipolar ablation found higher amenorrhoea rates and lower hysterectomy rates in the bipolar group. There was a significant improvement in health-related quality of life in both groups (Kleijn et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 10 year follow-up of first generation ablation techniques (e.g. rollerball ablation) reported a 22% hysterectomy rate, reduced to 6% if the first treatment was successful at 2 years (Fürst et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Uterine Artery Embolisation (UAE)</em><br />UAE is an effective, safe and acceptable method of treating HMB (Writing Committee for the REST Trial participants, 2007).</p>\n<p>UAE is recommended as a first line treatment when fibroids are found with HMB. It potentially allows women to become pregnant in the future, but there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. </p>\n<p>New evidence:<br />An RCT found UAE to be a successful alternative to hysterectomy: 81% of patients had avoided hysterectomy 2 years after a technically successful UAE (77% on an intention to treat analysis). The two treatments had comparable effects on improvement of pain and bulk symptoms (Volkers et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 24 month follow-up RCT of UAE vs. hysterectomy found that the treatments had a comparable adverse effect on ovarian reserve. The decrease in anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) - signalling ovarian activity - remained throughout follow-up and was higher than the decrease expected through ageing alone. The study concluded that women who wish to conceive in the future should only consider UAE after counselling (Hehenkamp et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Myomectomy<br /></em>Myomectomy is recommended when fibroids are found and potentially allows a woman to become pregnant in the future but, as with UAE, there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. </p>\n<p>In women with iron deficiency anaemia due to uterine fibroids, a single depot injection of the GnRH-a, goserelin acetate 10.8mg, with iron tablets 12 weeks before surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy), was shown to restore haemoglobin, alleviate fibroid symptoms, decrease uterine and fibroid size and decrease the incidence of uterine bleeding more effectively than iron monotherapy. These data confirm the results of previous trials using multiple administrations of goserelin acetate and indicate that the same effects can be achieved with a single administration (Muneyyirci-Delale et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>An RCT looking at the role of cetrorelix acetate, an GnRH-a antagonist, as a short term, pre-surgical treatment of fibroids found that after one month of treatment, consisting of 4x10mg doses, uterine volume decreased by 42% (placebo 11%). After 4 weeks treatment, HMB and pain symptoms had substantially improved compared to the placebo group. However, due to the small study size and short length of follow-up it is not possible to recommend cetrorelix acetate as a treatment for HMB (Engel et al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Hysterectomy<br /></em>Hysterectomy is a very effective treatment for HMB but, in general, it is an option used when others have failed or been rejected. It is associated with complications although for some areas, e.g. sexual functioning, evidence suggests that this may improve rather than deteriorate as has been supposed in the past (Halmesmaki et al., 2007). There is clearly no possibility of a woman becoming pregnant after the procedure.<br /> <br />New evidence:<br />The studies referred to in the text above confirm the role of hysterectomy as the definitive treatment of HMB and highlight the risks associated with this major surgery (Dickersin et al., 2007; El Nashar et al., 2007; Hehenkamp et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>HMB is a common problem impacting on physical, psychological and social well-being. However, it is reasonably simple to investigate and there are a number of effective treatments available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <br /><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Clegg JP, Guest JF, Hurskainen R.

The review includes 6 heterogenous studies involving 527 fetuses.  They found that a decrease in spectral energy in the low frequency bands was present in 5 out of 6 studies in the presence of fetal distress. The authors advised that larger prospective studies are needed to establish the exact diagnostic value of spectral analysis for  prediction of fetal distress. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Cardiotocography is not recommended in healthy women with an uncomplicated pregnancy during routine antenatal visits as there is no evidence supporting its use.  There is evidence that its routine use in healthy pregnant women can be detrimental, increasing anxiety levels (Mancuso et al 2008).</p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (Pattison and McCowan, 2000) which included 4 RCTs and 1588 participants assessed the effects of antenatal CTG monitoring on perinatal morbidity and mortality.

The pain generally increases as pregnancy advances, interfering with daily activities, preventing women from going to work and disturbing sleep.  The exact aetiology remains unclear, but causes are thought to include postural change and increased levels of the hormone relaxin. Affected women should be advised that both core strengthening and aerobic exercise in water, at home or in group classes, can be beneficial. Massage has also been shown to be useful. <br /></p>\n<p>A thorough review (Kramer and McDonald, 2006) found only eleven high quality studies (total n=472) from 1980 to 2005 which dealt with the effect of aerobic exercise (or advice on aerobic exercise) on the healthy mother and fetus, none of which provided strong evidence for benefit or harm. The only strong conclusion was that exercise improves the physical fitness of pregnant women. Notably, this systematic review was concerned with healthy women, not those reporting symptoms of symphysis pubis dysfunction.  <br /></p>\n<p>In contrast, a RCT (n=390) showed water aerobics to be superior to land exercise in both lower back pain relief (p=0.04) and consequent sick leave (p=0.03) (Granath et al., 2006). <br /></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2007 (n=301, half with, half without symptoms at 24 weeks) of twelve weeks of aerobic and strengthening exercises reported significantly reduced lumbo-sacral pain at 36 weeks and three months post-partum, but no reduction in sick leave. A significant but slight increase was shown in functional measures of daily life. Note that exercise was in groups of subjects, and twelve were lost to follow-up (Mørkved et al., 2007).    <br /></p>\n<p>A recent Cochrane review (2007) looked at the evidence for preventing and treating back and pelvic pain in pregnancy.  Eight studies (1305 participants) were included looking at the effects of adding various pregnancy specific exercises, physiotherapy, acupuncture and pillows to the usual prenatal care.  There were no studies dealing specifically with the prevention of back and pelvic pain in pregnancy.  For women with low back pain, those participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises (standardized mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.40 to -4.27) and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain related sick leave (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI0.17 to0.92) versus usual prenatal care alone.  Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care, while acupuncture gave more relief to evening pain than exercises.  All but one of the studies included had a high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously.  While adding pregnancy specific exercises or acupuncture to normal prenatal care does appear to relieve back pain, the effects are small and it is unclear whether they actually prevent pain from starting in the first place.  Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work (Kihlstrand 1999) and acupuncture shows better results than physiotherapy.<br /></p>\n<p>A recent systematic review looked at the evidence for acupuncture as a treatment for back and pelvic pain in pregnancy (Ee et al 2007).  The review was limited by the small number of RCTs included (3); in addition, none of the trials included a placebo acupuncture arm.  Overall, the review found limited but promising evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in managing pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.<br /></p>\n<p>Elden et al (2008) followed up a RCT of women with pelvic girdle pain, comparing standard management with acupuncture (n=125), standard management with stabilising exercises (n=131) and standard management (n=130) alone to look beyond treatment of pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy to its regression post delivery.  They found approximately 3/4 of women were pain free 3 weeks post delivery and there was no difference in speed of recovery between the three treatment groups.  According to detailed physical examination, pelvic girdle pain had resolved in 99% of women by 12 weeks post delivery.<br /></p>\n<p>A RCT in Norway in 2004 (n=301) reported a small but significant decrease in number of prolonged cases of second-stage labour, following 16 weeks of pelvic floor exercises. However, the reduction in average duration of second-stage labour was not statistically <br />significant (p=0.06) (Salvesen and Morkved, 2004). </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Symphysis pubis dysfunction is rarer, but the lack of rigorous criteria leads to difficulty in definition, and hence difficulty in estimating incidence (0.03 to 3% of pregnancies). For example, it is unclear whether the term applies just during pregnancy or post-partum as well. Pharmacological analgesia, sensitive to the demands of pregnancy, and physical support devices are recommended, but only one study (n=90) supports this conclusion (Depledge et al., 2005).<br /></p>\n<p><br /><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) during pregnancy has an estimated incidence of 21% to 62%. It is possibly due to increased fluid retention, and may be extended post-partum by breast feeding. Symptoms should resolve spontaneously, but if the nerve compression is severe and prolonged, permanent nerve damage and muscle wasting may result. There is no good evidence for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women. Interventions include analgesia, corticosteroid injection and, in extremis, surgery.<br /></p>\n<p>CTS during pregnancy is considered to have a short and relatively benign course.  Mondelli et al (2007) reported a 3 year follow-up after delivery of 45 women with CTS diagnosed on clinical and neurographic findings.  At three years, 51% were symptom free and 49% had anomalous (&gt;1) Boston Questionnaire (BQ) scores on symptoms and functional status, but mean BQ scores had improved from baseline and one year post delivery.  Only one woman underwent surgery and 11% continued to wear a splint at night at 3 years follow-up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.   1.

(2008) performed a meta-analysis (53 articles including 10,149 women) that examined factors, which may have a bearing on the success of ECV.  The mean overall success rate of ECV was 53%.  They found that multiparity (OR 2.5; 95% CI 2.3-2.8), non-engagement of the breech (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 6.3-14), a relaxed uterus (OR 18; 95% CI, 12-29), a palpable fetal head (OR 6.3; 95% CI 4.3-9.2) and maternal weight less than 65 kg (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.6) were all factors in predicting the success of ECV.  Fundal height and gestational age had no effect on the chances of success. The authors concluded that women undergoing ECV should be counselled with these factors in mind. </p>\n<p>A meta-analysis by Grootscholten et al. (2008) considered the safety of ECV. They found 84 relevant studies involving 12,995 ECV attempts and found that ECV is a safe procedure (providing it is performed in a facility where a Caesarean section can be performed), with a complication rate of 6.1% (95% CI 4.7-7.8), a serious complication rate of 0.24% (95% CI 0.17-0.34) and an emergency Caesarean section rate of 0.35% (95% CI 0.26-0.47). They also noted that the complication rate was not related to whether ECV has been successful or not. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>The recently updated 1996 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Kulier) of ECV for breech presentation at term included 5 RCTs (433 women) carried out prior to December 2004, assessing the effects of ECV at or near term (after 37 weeks) on measures of pregnancy outcome. The pooled data from these studies showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non-cephalic birth (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 - 0.80) and Caesarean section (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.91) when ECV was attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings &lt;7 at 1 or 5 minutes, low umbilical artery pH levels, neonatal admissions, perinatal death or time from enrolment to delivery. There was not enough evidence from the RCTs to assess complication rates but large observational studies at the time of writing suggested that complications are rare.<br />A Cochrane review in 2006 (Hutton and Hofmeyr) examined the effectiveness of ECV for breech presentation before term (&lt; 37 weeks). The review included 3 RCTs (515 women) and concluded that, compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non-cephalic presentation and Caesarean section. Further trials are needed to confirm this finding and to rule out increased rates of preterm birth or other adverse perinatal outcomes.<br />In 2008, the Early ECV Group (Hutton et al.) published a secondary analysis of the 178 women who had early ECV, as part of the RCT looking at procedural and pre-procedural factors associated with successful early ECV. Multiparity and a non-engaged, presenting part were significant pre-procedural predictors of ECV success. Others included lower reported maternal pain scores during the procedure, a single attempt at ECV and a more mobile fetus. Non-engagement of the presenting part was the only modifiable factor predicting ECV success that was identified in this analysis, and the authors concluded that this supports the hypothesis that beginning the ECV procedure earlier in pregnancy, prior to engagement, may have merit.<br />The Early ECV 2 Trial (1480 participants) is currently underway comparing early ECV (34-35 weeks) versus ECV at term (37 weeks); the primary and secondary outcomes are Caesarean section and preterm labour rates.</p>\n<p><br />Interventions to increase the success rate of ECV<br />Success rates of ECV vary widely (average = 58%, range 35-86%) and 1 in 6 successful cephalic versions revert back to a breech presentation. Tocolytic drugs to relax the uterus, as well as other methods, have been used in an attempt to facilitate successful ECV at term.<br />A 2007 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Gyte) included RCTs investigating the effects of routine tocolysis, fetal acoustic stimulation, epidural or spinal analgesia and transabdominal amnioinfusion for ECV at term. It concluded that, although the methodological quality of the RCTs was not ideal, routine tocolysis appears to increase the success rate of ECV at term. Routine tocolysis with beta-stimulants was associated with fewer failures (6 trials, 617 women, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.87). At the time of writing there was not enough evidence to evaluate the use of fetal acoustic stimulation, spinal or epidural anaesthesia or transabdominal amnioinfusion.<br />A 2008 RCT (Weiniger et al.) with 70 nulliparous participants compared the success of ECV with and without spinal analgesia. Successful ECV occurred in 24 of 36 (67%) women who received spinal analgesia compared to 11 of 34 (32%) without (P=0.004). Spinal analgesia also resulted in a lower visual analogue pain score. Placental position, estimated fetal weight and maternal weight did not contribute to the success rate when spinal analgesia was used. There were no cases of placental abruption or fetal distress.</p>\n<p>A 2004 RCT (El-Sayed et al.) compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous nitroglycerin with subcutaneous terbutaline (beta-2 agonist) as a tocolytic agent for ECV at term. Subcutaneous terbutaline was associated with a significantly higher rate of successful ECV compared with intravenous nitroglycerin (55% vs. 23%, p=0.02).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Mode of Delivery</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence</strong> <br />Poor outcomes after breech birth may be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation or be related to factors associated with the delivery. Planned Caesarean section has been randomised against planned vaginal delivery in several trials to assess the effect of mode of delivery on measures of pregnancy outcome.<br />Results from the multi-centre Term Breech trial (Term Breech Collaborative Group 2004), in which 1159 women were recruited from 121 centres in 26 countries, showed that planned Caesarean section decreased the risk of adverse perinatal outcome due to both problems in labour (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.45, P &lt; 0.001) and delivery (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.87, P= 0.03) for the singleton breech presentation at term, compared with planned vaginal birth.<br />A follow-up questionnaire, answered by 917 (79%) of the original mothers in the trial, reported in 2004 (Hannah M.E. et al.) that planned Caesarean delivery was not associated with a significant difference in maternal outcomes, or reduction in risk of death or neurodevelopmental delay in children at 2 years of age.<br />A 2007 Cochrane review (Hofmeyr and Hannah M.E.), which included 3 RCTs (2396 participants), reported that planned Caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced neonatal mortality and serious morbidity rates (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 - 0.56), at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 -1.61).<br />A 2007 RCT (Nassar et al.) concluded that a decision aid is an effective and acceptable tool for pregnant women that can provide an important adjunct to standard counselling for the management of breech presentation. The decision aid used in this trial was a 24-page booklet supplemented by a 30-minute CD and worksheet designed for women to take home and review with a partner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Maternal posture and cephalic version</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Many postural techniques have been used to promote cephalic version.<br />A Cochrane review in 2000 (Hofmeyr and Kulier) included 5 trials (392 women) comparing postural management with pelvic elevation for breech presentation versus a control. No effect of postural management on the rate of non-cephalic births was detected and the review recommended that further research in this area is needed.<br /></p>\n<p>Complementary Therapy and Cephalic Version</p>\n<p>A small RCT in 2003 (Habek et al., 69 participants) found that in women with breech presentation, 30 minutes of acupuncture a day from 34 weeks,  significantly increased the conversion of breech to cephalic presentation (76.4% v. 45.4% p&lt;0.01). They concluded that acupuncture correction of fetal malpresentation is a relatively simple, efficacious and inexpensive method associated with a lower percentage of operatively completed deliveries.</p>\n<p>A 2005 Cochrane review (Coyle, Smith and Peat), which included 3 RCTs and 597 participants, concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of moxibustion (a type of Chinese medicine which involves burning a herb close to the skin) to correct breech presentation.</p>\n<p>A 2008 systematic review (van den Berg et al.) evaluated the effectiveness of ‘acupuncture-type’ interventions (moxibustion, acupuncture or electro-acupuncture) to acupuncture point BL 67 located at the tip of the 5th toe versus expectant management to correct breech presentation. It included 6 RCTs (818 women) and 3 cohort studies (606 women). In the RCTs, the pooled proportion of breech presentations was 34% (95% CI: 20-49%) following treatment versus 66% (95% CI: 55-77%) in the control group (OR 0.25 95% CI: 0.11-0.58). The pooled proportion in the cohort studies was 15% (95% CI: 1-28%) versus 36% (95% CI: 14-58%), (OR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.43). Including all studies, the pooled proportion was 28% (95% CI: 16-40%) versus 56% (95% CI: 43-70%) (OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15-0.46). The authors concluded that their results suggest that acupuncture-type interventions on BL 67 are effective in correcting breech presentation compared to expectant management. However, there are many flaws to the study including small sample sizes of RCTs; non-reporting of study design and certain outcomes in some studies; the use of a variety of interventions and protocols and a lack of placebo controls. Further RCTs of improved quality are necessary to answer this research question adequately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Diet<h3>1.3 Diet</h3><br /><br /><br /><h3>Caffeine intake during pregnancy</h3>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />A Cochrane review (Jahanfar and Sharifah, 2009) investigated the effects of reducing caffeine intake in pregnancy on a range of fetal, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Only one trial (in which women were randomised to drink caffeinated (n=587), or decaffeinated (n=629), instant coffee) met the inclusion criteria for the review.  No significant differences between the groups were found in terms of birthweight, or pre-term and small for gestational age rates. They concluded that there is insufficient evidence available to advise expectant mothers about caffeine intake and further investigation is warranted in this field. </p>\n<p>A prospective, longitudinal, observational study by the CARE group (which was not included in the Cochrane review) found that caffeine consumption during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of IUGR. Methodological flaws in this study have been raised, such as insufficient adjustment for smoking and the effects of nausea. Despite this, the Food Standard Agency has recommended that the maximum daily caffeine intake for pregnant women should be 200mg, not 300mg as in the 2008 NICE guideline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Folate and other micronutrient supplementation</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A systematic review (Johnson and Little, 2008) considered the effect of folate and multivitamins on the development of cleft lip (with or without cleft palate) and cleft palate alone. They found that the use of multivitamins by mothers was inversely associated with the presence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate, but this association was non-significant for cleft palate alone. They found little evidence to describe an association between folate intake and oral clefts; they also suggested that, although use of multivitamins early in pregnancy may affect oral cleft outcomes, the evidence may be confounded by other factors in women taking vitamin supplements, such as a generally healthier lifestyle. </p>\n<p>A meta-analysis (Shah and Ohlsson, 2009) demonstrated that, compared to placebo, dietary supplementation with micronutrients reduced the risk of low birthweight. Taking multi-micronutrient supplementation also reduced the risk of low birthweight compared to iron and folic acid supplementation alone. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Pregnant women (and those intending to become pregnant) should be informed that dietary supplementation with folic acid, before conception and up to 12 weeks’ gestation, reduces the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. The recommended dose is 400 mcg per day (although there is some evidence that this dose may need to be adjusted for smokers (Shikany et al., 2004)). </p>\n<p>A meta-analysis by Goh et al. (2006) reported that maternal consumption of folic acid-containing prenatal multivitamins is associated with a decreased risk of several congenital anomalies, not only neural tube defects. The strongest evidence exists for prevention of cardiovascular and limb defects, with more debateable evidence for prevention of cleft palate, urinary tract anomalies and hydrocephalus.</p>\n<p>Vitamin A supplementation (intake greater than 700 mcg) might be teratogenic and therefore should be avoided. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin A supplements can reduce maternal mortality and further work needs to be done in this area (van den Broek et al., 2002). <br /> <br />There is insufficient evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy other than one RCT, which suggested protection against tooth decay (Thaver et al. 2005).<br /> <br />There is significant debate but insufficient evidence to support supplementation during pregnancy with vitamin C. The most recent systematic review (Polyzos et al. 2007), incorporating 4 trials and a total of 4,680 women receiving a combined intervention of vitamin C and vitamin E, showed no significant differences between vitamin and placebo groups for prevention of pre-eclampsia, fetal or neonatal loss, a small for gestational age infant or preterm birth. A Cochrane review (Rumbold &amp; Crowther  2005) concluded that vitamin C supplements did not significantly affect rates of stillbirth, perinatal death, birthweight or IUGR.<br /> <br />A review of the benefits of vitamin D supplementation was undertaken by the National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health for the NICE public health programme (2008). Vitamin D supplementation is advised for pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency, e.g. those of South Asian, African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern family origin, and those with limited exposure to sunlight or a diet low in vitamin D. At booking, all women should be informed of the importance of maintaining an adequate store of vitamin D and told that they can take 10 mcg vitamin D per day to achieve this. It is pertinent to check that women in high risk groups are taking this advice. <br /> <br />A Cochrane review (Rumbold et al. 2005) which did not differentiate between vitamins, reported that taking vitamin supplements, alone or in combination with other vitamins, prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy, does not prevent miscarriage or stillbirth.  However, women taking vitamin supplements appeared less likely to develop pre-eclampsia (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.85, four trials, 5580 women) and more likely to have a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.70, three trials, 20,986 women).</p>\n<p>Helathy Start is a new NHS scheme that replaces the previous Welfare Food Scheme. Free vitamin supplements (Vitamin C, D and folic acid) are available for pregnant women who meet certain criteria (<a href=\"http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/index.asp\">http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/index.asp</a>).</p>\n<p>Iron supplementation should not be offered routinely to all pregnant women because of potential side-effects. An RCT (Casaneuva et al. 2006) showed that the risk of haemoconcentration is reduced in weekly, compared to daily, iron supplementation. A Cochrane review (Pena-Rosas &amp; Viteri, 2006) concluded that further studies are needed to assess the effects of routine antenatal iron supplementation on clinically important outcomes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Calcium supplementation</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>A systematic review (Bergel &amp; Baros, 2007) reported a possible inverse association between maternal calcium intake during pregnancy and the children’s blood pressure, but the authors concluded that the trials were under-powered and they recommended further research. A Cochrane review  by Hofmeyr et al. (2006) reported that calcium supplementation appears almost to halve the risk of pre-eclampsia (12 trials, 15,206 women: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.69), with the effects greatest for high risk women and those with low baseline calcium intake. The WHO systematic review in 2006 (Villar et al.) found that calcium supplementation among low calcium intake pregnant women did not prevent pre-eclampsia but did reduce its severity, as well as maternal morbidity and neonatal mortality.</p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>The risk of Listeriosis can be reduced by drinking only pasteurised or UHT milk, and avoiding mould-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, pâté and undercooked ready-meals. The risk of salmonella infection can be reduced by avoiding undercooked eggs (or food containing eggs) and meat (especially poultry).<br /> <br />A 2006 Cochrane review (Makrides et al.)  concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of marine oil or other prostaglandin precursor supplements during pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight or small-for-gestational age infants.</p>\n<p>A 2007 Cochrane review (Duley &amp; Henderson-Smart) has shown that there is no evidence that a reduced salt intake during pregnancy lowers the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, although the authors stress that this is not related to altering salt intake as a treatment for pre-eclampsia.<br /> <br />A 2006 Cochrane review (Kramer &amp; Kakuma) including 4 trials and 451 participants reported that an antigen avoidance diet for high-risk mothers is unlikely to reduce their children’s risk of atopic diseases substantially, and that such a diet may adversely affect maternal and/or fetal nutrition.<br /> <br />A 2007 Cochrane review (Mahomed et al.) of zinc supplementation during pregnancy found a small, but significant, relative reduction in preterm birth; the authors stressed that this effect was greatest in studies involving women of low income and that improving overall nutrition in these populations is a more urgent priority than micronutrient or zinc supplementation.<br /> <br />Villar et al. (2003) produced a comprehensive review of nutritional interventions during pregnancy from an international persepective.<br /> <br />Exposure of a fetus to maternal malnutrition has been shown, in a systematic review, to carry an increased risk of childhood obesity (Huang et al., 2007). Low birthweight appears to be a risk factor for many common diseases later in life such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Maternal obesity can carry an increased risk of neural tube defects (Rasmussen et al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1. CARE Study Group. (2008).

A systematic review (Hammarberg et al., 2008) looked at emotional differences between couples who had needed assisted conception compared to those who conceived naturally. This large review included many trials with different inclusion criteria; however, they all covered emotional aspects of pregnancy, childbirth and early parenting. The studies included in the review produced some contradictory results, potentially due to the difference in inclusion criteria in the trials.  What follows is a summary of the main findings. During pregnancy, there were no differences in general anxiety levels or in depressive symptoms between the two groups, but there may have been more specific anxieties regarding fetal health in those women who had assisted conception. In terms of adjustment to pregnancy, those women who had assisted conception seemed more able to cope with physical changes during pregnancy and found it less uncomfortable. They were also less concerned about the sex of the fetus, associated financial worries related to pregnancy and loss of independence. There was, however, a paper which contradicted this and found that women who had assisted conception were more likely to describe themselves in a negative way during pregnancy. In terms of childbirth, there were no differences in the experiences of labour between the two groups. Looking at parenthood, the study suggested that those couples who had assisted conception may tend to idealise parenthood and be less prepared for what it entails than other couples, and feel less able to express this. Generally though, couples who have undergone assisted conception are at least as happy with pregnancy and what follows as those who conceived naturally and tend to have a longer relationship. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Although pregnancy is often thought of as a time of emotional wellbeing, 15% to 25% of childbearing women develop a clinically significant mental heath disorder in the interval between conception and the first year postpartum.  It is important that women are made aware of symptoms and monitored throughout this period.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The prevalence rate of antenatal depression can range from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.8% in the second trimester.  Many women are concerned over drug effects on fetal and infant health and look to non-pharmacological treatment options (psychosocial or psychological interventions and interpersonal psychotherapy).  With these concerns in mind, a 2007 Cochrane review (Dennis et al.) examined the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological methods in the treatment of antenatal depression.  Only one small US trial met the inclusion criteria meaning the authors were unable to make any recommendations as to the use of interpersonal psychotherapy in antenatal depression.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2006, an RCT with 227 participating pregnant women reported that the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) successfully elicited risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD). The authors stressed, however, that the detection of  depressive symptoms during pregnancy remains problematic (Blackmore et al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Postpartum mood disorders can range from the mild “baby blues” experienced by 50% to 80% of new mothers, through PPD to postpartum psychosis affecting less than 1%.  A 2004 Cochrane review examined the various interventions available to prevent women  developing PPD. Fifteen trials involving over 7600 women were included. Purely postnatal psychosocial interventions to reduce the numbers of women who develop PPD appear to more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than those that also include an antenatal component (Dennis and Creedy, 2004).  However, many questions remain unanswered and much research is required in this area. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

A 2006 Cochrane review (Meher &amp; Duley) concluded there is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of exercise on prevention of pre-eclampsia. A systematic review  (Harvey, 2003) found that post natal, but not antenatal, pelvic floor exercises were successful in reducing postpartum urinary incontinence. A 2006 Cochrane review (Caysens et al.) found insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programmes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sex</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Sexual intercourse during pregnancy is not known to be associated with any adverse outcomes. <br /></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Smoking</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the antenatal period was found to be associated with significantly reduced birthweight (33 grams 95% CI 16 to 51) and an increased risk of low birthweight (&lt;2500g) (OR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.63) in a systematic review by Leonardi-Bee et al. (2008).  There were no effects on gestational age at delivery or the risk of being small for gestational age.<br />A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies reported an increased risk of being overweight in the children of mothers who smoked in pregnancy (OR 1.50, CI: 1.36-1.65). This was not explained by socio-demographic or behavioural differences between the smokers and the control population (Oken et al., 2008).<br />A systematic review found there to be no convincing evidence that there is an association between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (Wendland et al., 2008). <br />A systematic review found a significantly higher rate of smoking cessation in those women given self-help material compared with those who received no such aids or usual ante-natal care (OR 1.83, CI: 1.23 to 2.73) (Naughton et al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Smoking in pregnancy is associated with several adverse outcomes: there is an increased risk of perinatal mortality, sudden infant death syndrome, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ectopic pregnancies, placenta praevia, preterm delivery, miscarriage, low birthweight and the development of cleft lip and cleft palate in children (DiFranza &amp; Lew 1995).  </p>\n<p>Women planning to conceive or those already pregnant should be encouraged to stop smoking or, if not possible, to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. Interventions that appear to be useful in reducing smoking include advice from a physician, group sessions, behavioural therapy, mental health counselling and point-of-care testing. A 2004 Cochrane review (Lumley et al.) concluded that smoking cessation programmes in pregnancy reduce the proportion of women who continue to smoke (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.95), and reduce low birthweight (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94) and preterm birth (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98). The pooled trials have inadequate power to detect reductions in perinatal mortality or very low birthweight. An RCT (Aveyard et al. 2005) found that advice to stop smoking was not associated with increases in maternal stress. One RCT (Aveyard et al. 2005) found no evidence of pregnant women’s partners quitting smoking and suggested that future interventions should focus on encouraging both partners to quit together. UK statistics show that nearly half of all women who smoked prior to pregnancy quit smoking whilst they are pregnant. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The risks and benefits of nicotine replacement therapy should be discussed with pregnant women who smoke – there is some concern that nicotine may cause harm to the fetus via vasoconstriction. It should only be considered if attempts to stop smoking without it have failed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The direct effects of cannabis on the fetus are uncertain but may be harmful, especially as it is associated with smoking. Women should be discouraged from using cannabis during pregnancy. A systematic review of addiction in pregnancy (Rayburn &amp; Bogenschutz, 2004) reported that clinical experience of anti-addictive medications for cannabis (and other substances of abuse) was very limited and that further work on anti-addiction medications would be helpful. A recent study also showed that recreational drug use in early pregnancy is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis (Draper et al., 2008), along with cigarette smoking. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Alcohol</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A systematic review of educational and psychological interventions designed to reduce alcohol consumption before or during pregnancy, suggested that such interventions may be effective, but a    meta-analysis could not be performed due to variable outcome parameters. (Stade et al. 2009).</p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Excess alcohol has an adverse effect on the fetus. Pregnant women should limit their exposure to no more than 1-2 standard units once or twice per week. Although it is uncertain how much alcohol must be consumed for the fetus to be damaged, there is little evidence of an effect at this low level. However, binge drinking, defined as more than 5 standard units on one occasion, should be avoided as it may be harmful to the fetus.  A recent systematic review of binge drinking in pregnancy  showed a possible adverse effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes but did not show any other convincing adverse effects (Henderson et al., 2007). An RCT (Chang et al. 2005) with 304 participants showed that a brief alcohol reduction intervention had most success in those pregnant women who were previously consuming high levels of alcohol; importantly, this effect was significantly enhanced when their partners also received the intervention. Women who are planning a pregnancy and those whose pregnancies are in the first three months should avoid alcohol altogether, as drinking alcohol probably carries an increased risk of miscarriage.</p>\n<p><br /><br /> <br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Gestational age assessment: LMP and ultrasound<h3>4.1 Gestational age assessment: LMP and ultrasound</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>No new evidence was identified by our updated literature search on this topic. The information included below has been reproduced from our 2008 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU<br /></strong>Dating of gestational age can be performed by calculation from the last menstrual period (LMP) using Naegele’s rule. Dating by the LMP is a simple, low cost method, but is limited by uncertainty over the LMP and concerns over delayed ovulation.  It is therefore recommended that all pregnant women should be offered an ultrasound dating scan between 10 weeks and 13 weeks and 6 days (NICE Guidelines 2008) to determine gestational age and detect multiple pregnancies. Accurate dating by ultrasound also enables optimal timing of screening for Down’s Syndrome and may reduce the rate of induction of labour after 41 weeks. A systematic review (Nielson 2001) of the use of ultrasound in early pregnancy included 9 RCTs and demonstrated a significant reduction in the rates of induced labour post-term. However, only 2 of these trials used ultrasound scans at less than 15 weeks.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2006, a RCT (Harrington 2006) looked at whether a first trimester dating scan using crown rump length (CRL) measurement reduces the induction of labour rate for prolonged pregnancy.  Gestational age was determined either by LMP or ultrasound measurement of the CRL between 8 and 12 weeks; 463 women were enrolled. For the scan group, the estimated date of delivery was altered if there was a discrepancy of more than 5 days compared with the LMP.  Although the trial had to be terminated early for unrelated reasons, no difference was found in the rate of induction for prolonged pregnancy between the scan (19 [8.2%]) and the no-scan (17 [7.4%]) groups.  The authors concluded, after acknowledging insufficient numbers were recruited, that there is no evidence that a first trimester ultrasound dating scan reduces the rate of induction of labour for prolonged pregnancy and that it may result in a more expensive healthcare strategy.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assessment of gestational age by measurement of CRL is most accurate in the first trimester, with 95% reliable prediction within 5 days (Robinson and Fleming, 1975). If a woman presents after 13 completed weeks of pregnancy, the head circumference or femur length should be used to determine the gestational age (BMUS guidelines).  Gestational age estimated by ultrasound scan in the second trimester is less accurate.<br />In order to calculate the gestational age from fetal measurements, a comparison is made with a gestational age specific reference.  The primary limitation of using ultrasound measurement for gestational age dating is therefore seen with symmetrically large or small fetuses where dates will be biased.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />More recent studies have looked at the use of transcerebellar diameter measurement for the prediction of gestational age in intrauterine growth restricted and large babies, creating specific normograms for such use.  Chavez et al (2007) demonstrated that for fetuses at the extremes of size, measurement of the transcerebellar diameter was a reliable and accurate method of predicting gestational age.</p>\n<p><br />  <br /> <br /><strong>2008 AEU References</strong> <br />1.

When an antacid was compared with an antacid plus ranitidine, the latter reduced symptoms but the result was not statistically significant. No useful information was given in the trials about maternal and fetal outcomes.  The authors were unable to draw conclusions about different treatments and recommended lifestyle changes first for mild heartburn in pregnancy women.  </p>\n<p>A meta-analysis of 7 studies has investigated whether first trimester use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)(n=1530) is associated with major malformations of the fetus (Gill et al., 2009) compared to those not exposed (n = 133410).  There was no significant increase in major malformations (OR 1.12 95% CI 0.86 – 1.45), and further analysis suggested no increase in spontaneous miscarriages or preterm deliveries. The authors concluded that PPIs are safe to use in pregnancy.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Reduced gastric motility in combination with insufficiency of the gastro-esophageal sphincter is a possible cause for an increased incidence of heartburn during pregnancy.  Life style modifications such as an upright posture, sleeping in a propped-up position and small, frequent meals are the first line treatments.  If these modifications fail alginate preparations may be used.  Antacids such as H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be effective without signs of teratogenicity in two clinical studies.  However, toxicity was detected in animal studies for omeprazole.  Therefore, both classes of drugs should only be used as a last resort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A Cochrane review (Hollier and Wendel, 2008) looked at whether antenatal antiviral prophylaxis in women with recurrent genital herpes (HSV) reduces the rates of neonatal herpes (primary outcome) and maternal HSV at presentation, recurrence at delivery, Caesarean section for HSV and side effects (secondary outcomes).  Seven RCTs were included: acyclovir v. placebo (n=5) and vancyclovir v. placebo (n=2).  One trial included women who had their first diagnosis of HSV infection during pregnancy, but all others included women infected prior to pregnancy. Treatment was started at 36 weeks gestation.  Symptomatic neonatal herpes did not occur in any of the studies so no conclusions could be drawn about this outcome.  However, results of the meta-analysis showed that women were significantly less likely to have a recurrence of genital herpes at delivery (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.43, absolute risk reduction of 10.7%) if they had received antiviral prophylaxis, and consequently less likely to have a Caesarean section due to HSV infection.  Limited evidence was available on neonatal effects of antiviral prophylaxis for genital HSV.  </p>\n<p>A Cochrane review by Swadpanich et al. (2008) looked at whether antenatal screening for lower genital tract infection and subsequent treatment would decrease the incidence of preterm birth.  The one trial that met the inclusion criteria recruited 4,155 women  less than 37 weeks gestation who had no complications such as vaginal bleeding and no symptoms of lower genital tract infection.  All women had a vaginal swab taken at an antenatal appointment.  They were then randomly allocated to: a) a group in which women who tested positive for lower genital tract infections (bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis) were treated or b) a group in which the swab results were not revealed and so antenatal care was not influenced. The primary outcome was preterm birth and secondary outcomes were low birthweight and very low birth weight infants, neonatal morbidity and admission to neonatal intensive care.  The incidence of preterm birth was significantly reduced in those women who were screened and treated for infections (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.75).  The incidence of preterm birth of a low or very low birthweight infant was also significantly reduced in those screened.  The authors concluded that screening for lower genital tract infection antenatally does decrease risk of preterm birth and so may be worthwhile.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Periodontal disease<br /></strong>Periodontal disease is believed to be a risk factor for pre-term birth.  A meta-analysis (Polyzos et al., 2009) found that treating periodontal disease with scaling and/or root planing significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.55, CI: 0.35 to 0.86).  Treatment was also associated with a marginally significant lower risk of low birth weight (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23-1.00).  No differences were found in the spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth rates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Constipation</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Increased progesterone levels decrease gastrointestinal movement during pregnancy.  A recent systematic review reported two studies, which showed that fibre supplements in the form of bran or wheat fibre increased the frequency of defecation and led to softer stools.  It appeared that stimulant laxatives were more effective than bulk-forming laxatives, but may have caused more side effects (Jewell and Young, 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Haemorrhoids</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium frequently become symptomatic causing local pain and pruritus, as well as bleeding.  A systematic review of treatment options included two studies, which showed that oral hydroxyethylrutosides reduced the <br />symptoms of first and second degree haemorrhoids during pregnancy.  However, no recommendation was made until further studies demonstrate maternal and fetal safety.  The most commonly used approaches, such as dietary change and local treatments, were <br />not properly evaluated during pregnancy and the puerperium (Quijano and Abalos, 2005). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Varicose veins</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Increased smooth muscle relaxation and total blood volume during pregnancy are believed to be the main causes for the higher incidence of varicose veins.  They may cause oedema together with night cramps, numbness, tingling, and heavy legs.  A systematic review found one trial which reported that oral rutoside significantly reduced the symptoms associated with varicose veins.  There were no significant differences in side-effects or incidence of deep vein thrombosis.  However, the study was small (69 women) and it is impossible to assess its safety in pregnancy. It therefore cannot be <br />routinely recommended. Compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema, but seem to relieve symptoms (Bamigboye and Smyth, 2007).  There is no evidence about the safety of surgical approaches during pregnancy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Vaginal discharge</strong> <br /></p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>The amount and consistency of vaginal discharge changes throughout pregnancy as a physiological process.  However, if the discharge has an offensive odour and/or is associated with local pruritus or dysuria it is recommended to test for possible bacterial or fungal infections. </p>\n<p>A recent update of a systemic review found that topical imidazole was more effective than nystatin, which had the same efficacy as hydragaphen.  Clotrimazole was more effective than placebo.  It appears that pregnant women should be treated for seven days with imidazole rather than for one to four days (Young and Jewell, 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

Similarly, the Cochrane review (Doyle et al., 2008) found that in those delivering before 37 weeks, the relative risk of cerebral palsy was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 - 0.87) and the number needed to treat, 63.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Maternal obesity<h3>3.6 Maternal obesity</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />A meta-analysis has confirmed that maternal obesity before, and in early, pregnancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of congenital abnormalities (Stothard, Tennant et al., 2009). In mothers with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, there was a significantly increased risk of neural tube defects (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.62-2.15), spina bifida (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.86-2.69), cardiovascular anomalies (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.12-1.51), septal anomalies (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.31), cleft palate (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.03-1.47), cleft lip and palate (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.03-1.40), anorectal atresia (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.12-1.97), hydrocephaly (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.19-2.36) and limb reduction anomalies (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The authors suggested this may be because of high blood glucose, nutritional deficiencies and/or difficulties with ultrasound resulting in fewer terminations of pregnancy.  Interestingly, however, the risk of gastroschisis was significantly reduced (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.1-0.3), perhaps because obesity is more common in older mothers, who are known to be at reduced risk of gastroschisis.  Another meta-analysis confirmed the positive association between maternal obesity and neural tube defects with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.34-2.15) for obese women and 3.11 (95% CI, 1.75-5.46) for those who were severely obese (Rasmussen, Chu et al. 2008). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Torloni et al. provide convincing evidence that the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is positively associated with pre-pregnancy BMI.  Those categorised as morbidly obese were at the highest risk.  The authors calculated that for every 1 kg m-2 increase in BMI, the incidence of GDM increased by 0.92% (95% CI 0.73 to 1.10).  Furthermore, underweight women were at a significantly reduced risk compared to women with a normal BMI (Torloni, Betran et al., 2009).  <br />Tieu et al. performed a Cochrane review of current dietary interventions for preventing GDM. Comparing the effects of low versus high glycaemic index diets, they showed a significantly reduced risk of large for gestational age infants and lower maternal fasting glucose levels in the low glycaemic index group (Tieu, Crowther et al. 2008).  However, the trials included were small (n=107) and further larger studies are advised.<br />Pre-pregnancy BMI has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of Caesarean delivery in nulliparous women, in a dose dependent manner: the risk was more than double in obese mothers compared to those with a normal pre-pregnancy BMI (Poobalan, Aucott et al., 2009).  These findings still held when adjustments were made for pre-eclampsia, diabetes and macrosomia.<br />A review of interventions for tackling obesity in pregnancy found numerous reports on the rates and complications of obesity in pregnancy, but very few on effective interventions (Birdsall, Vyas et al., 2009).  The article concluded by discussing ways in which this could be improved. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

The information included below has been reproduced from our 2008 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2008 AEU</strong><br />Prescriptions and dental treatments are free for women during pregnancy and for a year after the birth (Antenatal care guideline, 2008).  No new evidence-based data have been published since. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In general, most women can be reassured that it is safe to work during pregnancy.  However, their individual occupational risk should be assessed to minimise the exposure and risk.  It is recommended that pregnant women should be informed of their rights and risks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is some evidence that maternal working conditions may contribute to birth outcome.  For example, pregnant women who work in the manual sector have higher physical demands placed on them, more job hazards and less job control than those in the non-manual sector. These factors can be associated with an increased risk of low birthweight and preterm delivery, but not mortality (Gisselman et al. 2008). The most important factor was job control, raising the question that this may be a psychosocial effect. Interestingly, for all birth outcomes the analysis detected class differences remaining even after working conditions were taken into consideration. Nevertheless, a cohort study found that psychosocial stress in the first half of pregnancy does not increase the risk of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension (Vollebregt et al, 2008) – which has previously been a controversial issue. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One case-control study found an association between maternal work activity in pregnancy and pre-term delivery (Croteau et al. 2007). The activities included demanding posture for more than 3 hours per day, whole body vibrations and high job strain, combined with low or moderate social support. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Current UK legislation decrees that all women are entitled to 26 weeks of ‘Ordinary Maternity Leave’ and 26 weeks of ‘Additional Maternity Leave’. In addition, a woman is not allowed to return to work within two weeks after giving birth nor is it lawful for the employer to require her or allow her to do so.  The pregnant woman’s GP or midwife has to inform the employer if she decides to work past 33 weeks gestation (Antenatal Care Guideline, 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

For an overview of the current recommendations, please refer to the NICE guidelines. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Breast examination</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />A Cochrane review (Lee and Thomas, 2008) was published on the role of antenatal breast examination to determine if any problems with breastfeeding could be anticipated. However, no RCTs were identified so no evidence-based conclusions could be made.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Measurement of weight and body mass index</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />No new evidence available.  </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Three separate meta-analyses by Chu et al. in 2007 have shown maternal obesity to be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, Caesarean section and stillbirth. The risk of each of these outcomes rises with the severity of obesity. The normal range of gestational weight gain for each individual is enormously variable. Various tools have been devised to predict weight gain and fetal birthweight during pregnancy, and retention of weight post-partum.  In 2007, Kleinman et al. compared linear weight gain measurements with a novel area-under-the-weight-gain-curve method in an observational, prospective, cohort study with 2,016 participants. This novel method was shown to be a better predictor of 12, 24 and 36 month weight retention; however, no method was better than any other at predicting birthweight. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Female Genital Mutilation</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.  </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Female genital mutilation is still a large problem in many countries.  A recent inter-agency statement by OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIFEM and WHO builds upon decades of action by local communities, governments, and national and international organisations to reduce the prevalence of female genital mutilation. A similar statement was issued in 1997, but this revised version has support from a wider range of agencies.  It is also based on new evidence that has come to light over the last decade, in particular that neonatal outcomes are worse in women who have been mutilated, with the severity of the outcome worsening with the extent of mutilation. The statement provides the framework required to work towards eliminating the practice worldwide; emphasises both the human and legal issues surrounding the problem, and reports the results of research investigating why the practice continues and the impact it has on the health of women and girls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Domestic violence</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.  </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common occurrence in pregnancy and results in an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Pregnancy increases the risk to women subjected to IPV, and domestic violence is the biggest risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Pregnant women who are IPV victims have high rates of stress, are more likely to smoke or use other drugs, deliver a preterm or low birthweight infant, have an increase in infectious complications, and are less likely to obtain prenatal care. <br />However, a 2008 prospective cohort study (Audi et al.) with 1,229 participants found no statistically significant association between IPV perpetrated by partners and low birthweight or prematurity. <br />Current NICE guidelines for antenatal care state that women should feel able to discuss sensitive issues and disclose problems. Clinicians should be alert to the symptoms and signs of domestic violence.<br />A 2007 systematic review of the literature by Buck et al. identified that the three most commonly cited reasons why midwives did not ask about domestic abuse were lack of time, lack of training and inadequate resources. Raising awareness of the issue, improving basic education and increasing access to simple resources, such as leaflets giving details of where to get support, may provide midwives with the confidence to ask about domestic abuse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Psychiatric screening</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />Antenatal and postnatal depression have been shown to affect the cognitive and behavioural development of the child.  NICE guidelines recommend that two simple screening questions for depression should be asked on first contact with women in the antenatal and postnatal periods.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A Cochrane review (Austin et al., 2008) studied the effects of psychological assessment antenatally on perinatal mental health.  Two RCTs were included , which used different scoring systems.  The first looked at whether the use of  the ALPHA (Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment) tool by healthcare providers improved their ability to detect psychosocial issues.  No significant improvement was detected although there was a trend towards increasing suspicion of psychosocial concern by clinicians, particularly of family violence. A secondary analysis of this trial was performed by Blackmore et al. (2006) (see 2008 evidence update). The second RCT included 600 women identified as having significant risk for psychosocial problems and allocated them to one of three arms: assessment of their Edinburgh Depression Score (EDS) and a subsequent discussion on postnatal depression, a leaflet with advice on postnatal depression or standard care. No significant difference in EDS score at 16 weeks postpartum was seen between the groups. Of note, there was a very high drop-out rate in these studies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence</strong> <br />Use of the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) tool led to the detection of psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression in a 2006 secondary analysis of a previous RCT (Blackmore et al.). The authors concluded that this assessment may be particularly useful for raising and discussing sensitive issues, and the detection of risk factors may be improved by administering a simple standardised measure of depressive symptoms during routine antenatal care. However, there were no data to show that the assessment led to earlier interventions or had an effect on the incidence or outcome of postpartum depression.<br />In 2008, an Australian prospective cohort study by Milgrom et al. (40,333 participants) found that previous depression, current depression/anxiety and low partner support are key risk factors for postnatal depression, consistent with existing meta-analysis surveys. Current depression/anxiety (and to some extent social support) may be amenable to change and can therefore be targeted for intervention.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Treatment for antenatal depression</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />A Cochrane review (Dennis and Allen, 2008) looking at massage and acupuncture treatments for antenatal depression found only one small (n=61) trial that met the inclusion criteria. Women with major depression (DSM-IV criteria) were allocated to one of three arms: maternal massage, depression specific acupuncture or a control group of non-specific acupuncture.  Compared with placebo, there were no significant differences in the number of women diagnosed with depression immediately after the interventions or at 10 weeks postpartum.  However, the numbers included were small and so few conclusions can be drawn. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Medicines<h3>1.4 Medicines</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is important to understand the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy before considering the use of prescription/over-the-counter drugs or alternative medicines. Increased cardiovascular output, renal and endocrine function, reduced lung capacity and gastrointestinal motility, as well as changes in the drug-binding capacity of circulating proteins, have to be taken into account. Finally, many of the drugs used can pass the placental barrier and therefore reach the fetus.</p>\n<p>Very few prescription or over-the counter drugs have been tested in clinical trials for use in pregnancy, so most recommendations are based on case-control or anecdotal studies. Several reviews are presented below that find no evidence for a detrimental effect on pregnancy outcome with the use of certain drugs. However, a lack of evidence does not mean that these drugs are without risk and in many cases the British National Formulary (BNF) advises to avoid their use in pregnancy. It is, therefore, essential for healthcare professionals to provide the mother with the best evidence available so that she can make an informed decision.  Drugs should only be prescribed when the potential for benefitting the mother outweighs the potential for harming the fetus. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Epilepsy treatment </strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />A systematic review and meta-analysis (Meador K. et al., 2008) looked at the effect of in-utero exposure to anti-epileptic drugs on the incidence of congenital malformations. Most babies born to women with epilepsy are normal; however, the incidence of congenital malformations was on average three times higher (7.08%) than in controls (2.28%). The incidence was highest when polytherapy (16.78%) was used, especially when it included phenobarbital, phenytoin or sodium valproate. When monotherapy wasused, sodium valproate was associated with the highest risk of malformations (10.73%). The authors noted that the risk of congenital malformations must be balanced with the risk of seizures. </p>\n<p><br />  <br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence</strong> <br />A systematic review (Adab et al., 2004) looked at the use of common antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy with regard to potential adverse effects on fetal neurodevelopmental outcomes.  Most studies failed to identify any significant detrimental outcomes with in utero exposure to monotherapy with carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbitone.  However, polytherapy was more commonly associated with poorer outcomes, as was exposure to any antiepileptic drugs when analysis did not take into account the type of drug.  The authors recommended treating pregnant women with monotherapy at the lowest possible dose to achieve seizure control. A recent study found that in pregnant women taking antiepileptic medication, supplementation of their diets with folic acid at 5-12 weeks decreased the risk of congenital abnormalities, but does not eliminate it (Kjaer et al, 2008). </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Opiate dependence</strong> </p>\n<p>  <br /><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />A Cochrane systematic review (Minozzi et al., 2008) assessed the effectiveness of various pharmacological interventions for opiate-dependent pregnant women on maternal (drop out from treatment, use of heroin) and neonatal (mortality, neonatal abstinence syndrome, APGARS) outcomes. Only three studies with a total of 96 participants met the inclusion criteria: two compared methadone with buprenorphine and one methadone with slow release morphine. No difference was found between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of maternal drop-out or relapse;  slow release morphine was better than methadone in preventing relapse. In one trial, buprenorphine led to higher birthweights than methadone but this was not confirmed in the other trial. There were no other significant differences in neonatal outcome. The authors suggested more trials are needed to discover how best to manage these women. </p>\n<p><br />  <br /><strong>Anti-D prophylaxis</strong> <br /></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />A systematic review (Pilgrim et al., 2009) looked at the evidence for routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis, and carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis of different doses, regimens and products. Pooled results from two studies suggested that giving anti-D to all RhD negative women reduces the sensitisation rate from 0.95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 – 1.71) to 0.35% (95% CI 0.29 – 0.40), with an odds-ratio of 0.37 (95% CI 0.21 – 0.65), and an absolute risk reduction for sensitisation in RhD-negative mothers of 0.6% for a treatment that is associated with minimal adverse effects. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by giving anti-D prophylaxis to: a) all RhD-negative primigravidae or b) all RhD negative women, versus no treatment, were £9,000-15,000 and £20,000-35,000 respectively. The authors concluded that this is likely to be cost effective at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. </p>\n<p>In August 2008, NICE released new guidelines regarding Anti-D prophylaxis. The guidance does not change the target population or indications, but appraises a single and double dose antenatal regimen and advises use of the regimen associated with the lowest costs. <br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>IBD treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs</strong>   <br /></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />A meta-analysis by Rahimi et al. (2008) assessed adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, low birthweight, congenital abnormalities) in women with inflammatory bowel disease treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs compared to no medication. Most outcomes showed statistically non-significant increases in risk where medication was given (congenital abnormalities, odds ratio (OR) 1.16, stillbirth 2.38, spontaneous abortion 1.14, preterm delivery 1.35 but 0.93 for low birth weight). </p>\n<p> <br />  <br /><strong>Quinolones</strong> <br /></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />Bar-Oz et al. (2009) conducted a meta-analysis looking at the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (major congenital malformation, stillbirths, preterm births and low birth weight) after in utero exposure to quinolones in the first trimester of pregnancy. The analysis included 984 exposed women from 5 studies. No increased risks related to quinolone use were found.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of auto-immune diseases in pregnancy</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A systematic review (Sperber et al., 2009) found no differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, congenital malformation, live birth rate) between pregnant women with autoimmune disease who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and those who were not.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</strong>   <br /></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong> <br />A systematic review (Nicholson et al., 2009) compared the use of oral medication (metformin, glyburide (glibenclamide) and acarbose) with insulin in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Four RCTs were included in the analysis with a total of 1229 women. Caesarean section rates, maternal glycaemic control and neonatal birthweights were similar in glyburide and insulin treated women, and women taking oral medications and insulin had similar congenital malformation rates. The incidence of neonatal hypo-glycaemia was increased in the group treated with insulin (8.1% vs 3.3% P=0.008). These finding give support to the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy (2008), which for gestational diabetics who require medications, states ‘Hypoglycaemic therapy for women with gestational diabetes (which may include regular insulin, rapid-acting insulin analogues [aspart and lispro] and/or hypoglycaemic agents [metformin and glibenclamide] should be tailored to the glycaemic profile of, and acceptability to, the individual woman’.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Medications for Depression</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>In view of the recent controversy regarding a possible association between paroxetine and fetal cardiac malformations, O’Brien et al. (2008) conducted a meta-analysis of 9 studies of women who had been exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester. Analysis of 3 case control studies found no increased risk of cardiac malformations (OR 1.18 CI 0.88-1.59). Six cohort studies found a non-significant weighted average difference of 0.3% (95% CI -0.1 to 0.7%; P = 0.19). The authors hypothesised that the positive association found in the meta-analysis by Bar-Oz et al. (2007) (see 2008 evidence update) may have been due to publication bias of positive results.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>A meta-analysis looking at the effects of paroxetine, an SSRI antidepressant drug, found that first trimester exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of fetal cardiac malformation (Bar-Oz et al., 2007). However, another recent study did not find any evidence that taking SSRI or TCA antidepressants increased the risk of congenital (including cardiac) malformations (Davis et al., 2007).  The same study found that taking antidepressant medication in the third trimester may increase the risk of perinatal complications, and when taken at any time during pregnancy may increase the risk of preterm labour. Discontinuation of mood stabilising drugs during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus, but it has also been suggested that the harm to the mother may outweigh this (Viguera et al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <br /><strong>Anti-histamines</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A 2008 meta-analysis (Schwartz et al.) concluded that there is no risk of hypospadias associated with loratadine use during pregnancy: OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.69 – 2.39. Of 2,694 boys born to women who were exposed to loratadine during pregnancy, 1.4% (n=39) had hypospadias, compared to a figure of 0.9% (n=4,231) in the 45,413 boys born to unexposed women. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Aspirin and NSAIDs</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A systematic review investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin as a preventative treatment for pre-eclampsia.  Aspirin was associated with reduced pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality rates, as well as a reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth and an increase of 215 g in mean birthweight.  There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (Coomasaramy et al., 2003).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Oxytocin antagonists for inhibiting preterm labour</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>A Cochrane review (Papatsonis et al., 2009) looked at the evidence for the use of maintenance therapy with oxytocin antagonists following an episode of preterm labour to prevent further preterm labour. Only one suitable trial was identified, which showed that atosiban did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth before 37, 32, or 28 weeks, nor did it have any effect on neonatal morbidity or perinatal mortality. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Therapies</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>See section 2.4 for a summary on acupuncture in pelvic and back pain.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>A few RCTs have examined the use of alternative medicines and treatments during pregnancy:</p>\n<p>* Relaxation techniques and micronutrient supplements have been shown to be beneficial in pregnancy (Ahn et al., 2006; Bastani et al., 2005). However, analyses revealed no added benefit of multiple-micronutrient, compared with iron/folic acid supplementation (Haider and Bhutta, 2006).</p>\n<p>* A systematic review found that moxibustion may reduce the need for external cephalic version for breech presentation.  However, the authors could not make a recommendation due to an insufficient sample size (Coyle et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>* Acupuncture has been shown to relieve abdominal pain (Lund et al., 2006) and reduce the use of paracetamol in pregnant women suffering from lower back pain (Guerreiro da Silva et al., 2003).  However, the numbers in these trials were small.  Another small RCT demonstrated that the use of acupuncture reduces the need for external cephalic version in breech presentation.</p>\n<p>* Acupressure over the volar aspect of the wrist at the P6 point does not result in a significant reduction in the amount of antiemetic medication, the requirement for intravenous fluid, or median duration of in-patient stay in women hospitalised for hyperemesis gravidarum  (Heazell et al., 2006). Low-level nerve stimulation therapy at the P6 point seems to have a beneficial effect in treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (Rosen et al., 2003). </p>\n<p>* Blue cohosh has been used by some as a labour-inducing aid. However, it should be used only with extreme caution as there have been reports of serious adverse outcomes (Dugoua et al., 2008).</p>\n<p>Women should not assume that complementary medicines are without adverse effects; very few have been established to be safe and effective when used in pregnancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Methodology<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>The aim of the literature search for the 2009 Annual Evidence Update was to update the original searches carried out in 2007 and 2008. Search strategies devised last year were revised and re-run for 2008-2009. The databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, OVID Medline, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As a result of the huge volume of literature published in this area each year we limited our search to identifying only systematic reviews and meta-analyses published within the last year. The search terms used included antenatal care; prenatal care; pregnancy; maternal health services; maternal care; prepregnancy care; pregnancy trimesters; obstetric care; prenatal period and additional variants of these terms. These were combined with terms to filter for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and limited to ‘English in language’. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of the 784 papers identified were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this update. </p>\n<p>This AEU looks at rountine antenatal care. It does not deal with the management of pregnancy related disorders such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus. We hope to exand to cover such subjects in the future and as a start have included two extra topics this year; progesterone and preterm birth and magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the preterm fetus. <br /></p>\n<p>The full-text of papers identified as relevant were obtained; similarly, for other papers if doubt existed about the appropriateness of the data the full-text paper was found. After examining the full-text, 55 papers were deemed to be relevant and were included in the AEU summaries. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The AEU summaries included are based on the existing NICE guidelines, updated in March 2008, which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited. Readers are referred to the NICE guideline for the citation details of the older studies. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=324316&amp;tabID=289\"><strong>Link back to AEU contents page.</strong></a></p>\n<p><br /> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy<h3>2.2 Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>No new evidence was identified by our literature search on this topic. The information included below has been reproduced from our 2008 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU<br /></strong>More than 80% of pregnant women experience nausea and 50% vomiting in the first trimester. The symptoms do not adversely affect the mother or fetus, but can have an impact on quality of life. Pregnant women should be advised that nausea and vomiting are usually normal and harmless symptoms, which resolve spontaneously by 16 to 20 weeks gestation. Hyperemesis gravidarum is excessive vomiting leading to a state of fluid and electrolyte imbalance; it has an incidence of 3.5/1000 deliveries. Symptomatic relief is available. Effective interventions are P6 acupressure, ginger and antihistamines. There is good evidence that antihistamines are safe in this context. Although one cohort study showed that vitamin B6 appeared safe, doubts about its safety still exist so it is not recommended (NICE guidance, 2008). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lacasse et al (2008) validated the “Health-Related Quality of Life for Nausea and Vomiting during Pregnancy\" (NVPQOL).  Their data suggested that the NVPQOL is a reliable and valid index to measure nausea and vomiting specific quality of life in the first trimester.<br /><br /> <br /><strong>Ginger and Vitamin B6<br /></strong>A systematic review looked at six studies (total n=675) and confirmed that ginger improves both nausea and vomiting (Borelli et al., 2005). The review lacked large enough data sets to be able to confirm the safety of ginger. Another systematic review in 2005 <br />described doses of ginger up to 6g/day as safe, but recommended that it should only be administered in a clinical trial due to lack of good safety data (Betz et al., 2005). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two RCTs (n=291, n=138) compared vitamin B6 to ginger. Both RCTs concluded on the basis of weakly significant results that both ginger and vitamin B6 were equally effective in reducing nausea and vomiting. Safety data for neither ginger nor vitamin B6 were reported (Smith et al., 2004; Sripramote and Lekhyananda, 2003). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no new evidence on the safety of vitamin B6 in pharmacological doses, although a drug containing it, Benedictin (Debendox), was withdrawn in 1983 due to an apparent increase in limb abnormalities. Reviews of the studies reporting its teratogenicity do not support this fear.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Acupuncture and Acupressure<br /></strong>A review was undertaken of acupuncture for nausea and vomiting of any cause, including chemotherapy, motion sickness and pregnancy: results were mixed for pregnancy, but the review highlights the growing evidence for the general efficacy of acupuncture point <br />stimulation (Streitberger et al., 2006). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A RCT (n=230) compared acupuncture point nerve stimulation to placebo for mild to severe first trimester nausea and vomiting. This is in contrast to most other studies which involved in-patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. The study showed significant reduction of symptoms measured by the Rhodes index (P=0.02) thereby promoting weight gain (P=0.003) (Rosen et al., 2003). </p>\n<p><br /> <br />A single-blind RCT (n=80) showed no reduction in anti-emetics required when acupressure was used (Heazell et al., 2006). Another single-blind study (n=66) showed no benefit of acupressure when compared to vitamin B6 (Jamigorn and Phupong, 2007).  A trial (n=88) compared a combined acupuncture and acupressure regime with antihistamine plus vitamin B12. The trial was not blinded or placebo controlled. The trial measured somatic and functional improvement, showing similar benefit for both (Neri et al., 2005). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A more recent small (n=75) Turkish RCT (Can Gürkan and Arslan, 2008) compared acupressure to placebo in women with nausea with and without vomiting who were unable to receive conventional treatments.  Over a 9 day period 26 women received P6 acupressure on days 4-6 while the placebo group (n =  24) received sham acupressure, and 25 women acted as a control group.  The P6 acupressure group reported improvements in frequency of nausea (P&lt;0.001), severity of nausea (P&lt;0.05) and intensity of discomfort felt from nausea (P&lt;0.001) during the treatment days when compared to the pre-treatment days 1-3.  However, the placebo group also reported an improvement in all areas (P&lt;0.05).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Steroids<br /></strong>Two small RCTs (n=40, n=80) agreed that corticosteroids improved symptoms (Bondok et al., 2006; Ziaei et al., 2004). A slightly larger RCT (n=126) did not use symptomatic improvement as an end point, but showed hospital readmission was not reduced by adding a corticosteroid to an antihistamine regime (Yost et al., 2003). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Helicobacter Pylori</strong>  <br />A recent systematic review (Golberg et al 2007) looked at the relationship between Helicobacter Pylori (H.Pylori) and hyperemesis gravidarum.  Fourteen case control studies were identified, involving 1732 participants and controls.  Ten studies showed a significant association and odds ratios varied from 0.55 to 109.33, three results were less than 1.  While an association between H.Pylori and hyperemesis gravidarum was suggested by this review, considerable heterogeneity in the studies involved highlights study limitations.<br /></p>\n<p><br /> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

Adverse effects were similar in both groups except for uncomplicated bleeding, which was reported more frequently in the sweeping group. Other obstetric outcomes and indicators of neonatal morbidity were similar in both groups. There were two perinatal deaths in each group.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Induction of labour</strong><br />Note NICE Induction of Labour guideline published in July 2008.</p>\n<p><br /> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>Indications for induction<br />Mozurkewich et al. (2009) undertook a best evidence review of the indications for induction of labour.  They found that, induction of labour at 41 weeks could reduce perinatal mortality and meconium aspiration but not decrease the number of Caesarean sections compared to conservative management with antenatal monitoring.  They established that induction of labour following rupture of membranes at term (as opposed to more conservative measures of observation for 24 hours to 4 days), was associated with a decreased  incidence of chorioamnionitis and endometritis.  .There was insufficient evidence to support induction of labour for twin gestations, oligohydramnios, maternal diabetes, suspected fetal macrosomia, cholestasis, maternal cardiac disease and fetal gastroschisis.<br />A meta-analysis by Wennerholm et al. (2009) looked at the effect of elective induction of labour or expectant management of pregnancy at 41 weeks or beyond on perinatal mortality..  Thirteen trials were included and no significant difference in perinatal mortality between the two groups was found (RR 0.33 95% CI 0.1 – 1.09). There were lower rates of meconium aspiration syndrome and Caesarean section in those undergoing elective induction compared with those being managed expectantly.  However, because outcomes such as perinatal mortality are so rare, the authors concluded that the optimal management of pregnancies at 41 weeks and beyond is unknown.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Methods of Induction<br />The NICE guideline on induction of labour (2008) recommends the use of vaginal prostaglandin E2 for induction of labour. Misoprostol is not licensed for induction of labour in the UK and should only be used for those women with an intrauterine fetal death or as part of a clinical trial.  </p>\n<p><br />Low dose Oral Misoprostol<br />A systematic review by Kundodyiwa et al. (2009) looked at the updated evidence for low dose misoprostol for induction of labour compared to dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol and oxytocin in terms of safety and efficacy. It included 4 trials published since the Cochrane review of oral misoprostol for the induction of labour (Alfirevic and Weeks, 2007 – see 2008 evidence update) and was restricted to studies using 20-25 mcg, which has more potential for clinical practice.  Nine RCTs were included: oral misoprostol versus dinoprostone (n=5), oral versus vaginal misoprostol (n=3) and oral misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion (n=1).  They found that use of oral misoprostol (20mg every 2 hours) resulted in significantly less need for a Caesarean section than dinoprostone (RR 0.82 95% CI 0.71-0.96).  There were no significant differences in vaginal deliveries in 24 hours, the incidence of uterine hyperstimulation, the need for further oxytocin to augment labour, perinatal mortality or any maternal adverse events between the two groups.  Analysis of the three trials which compared oral and vaginal misoprostol  showed no significant difference in outcomes, except a significant reduction in uterine hyperstimulation associated with fetal heart rate changes in the group receiving oral misoprostol (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08–0.46).  The trial in which oral misoprostol was compared with intravenous oxytocin was only available in abstract form but no differences in outcome were reported.  The authors concluded that 20mg oral misoprostol seems at least as effective as dinoprostone and vaginal misoprostol for induction of labour. </p>\n<p><br />Intracervical Prostaglandins for induction of labour<br />A Cochrane review in 2008 (Boulvain et al., 2008) examined the evidence for intracervical prostaglandins for induction of labour.  Intracervical PGE2 was more effective at inducing labour before 24 hours than placebo (28 trials, RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79).  More women failed to achieve labour within 24 hours with intracervical, than with intravaginal, PGE2 (29 trials, RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.41).  The authors concluded that intracervical prostaglandins are effective compared to placebo, but appear inferior when compared to intravaginal prostaglandins.</p>\n<p><br />Sublingual Misoprostol for induction of labour<br />A systematic review by Souza et al., 2008, compared the efficacy and safety (e.g. uterine hyperstimulation and Caesarean section rates) of sublingual versus vaginal misoprostol for induction of labour. No significant differences were found between the two routes of administration.  However, the authors suggested that the safety, adverse effects, perinatal outcome and optimal dose for the oral route need to be established before its use can be routinely recommended. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>In most centres, labour is induced by intra-vaginal application of a prostaglandin-containing gel. The current gold standard is vaginal dinoprostone, which has been shown to reduce perinatal death and the rate of Caesarean section, while the frequency of instrumental deliveries remained unchanged. </p>\n<p><br />A 2007 Cochrane systematic review (Alfirevic and Weeks) assessed the safety and efficacy of oral misoprostol for the induction of labour.  The review included 41 trials and 8,606 women. In four trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (474 participants), labouring time, the need for oxytocin and the Caesarean section rate (intact membranes) were reduced in the oral misoprostol group.  In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone (2627 participants), uterine hyperstimulation was more common in women taking oral misoprostol, although this was not associated with any adverse fetal events. In the seven trials that compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin (1017 participants), the only difference between the groups was an increase in meconium-stained liquor in women with ruptured membranes following administration of oral misoprostol. Sixteen trials compared oral and vaginal misoprostol (3645 participants) and found no difference in the primary outcomes. There was less uterine hyperstimulation in those given oral misoprostol. The review concluded that oral misoprostol is more effective than placebo and at least as effective as vaginal dinoprostone. However, there remain questions regarding its safety due to a relatively high rate of uterine hyperstimulation and lack of dose ranging studies. Therefore, despite being cheap, stable at room temperature and effective in causing uterine contractions, oral misoprostol has not been licensed for use in pregnancy in most countries.  Reports of uterine rupture in women with a previous Caesarean section mean that it remains contraindicated in this group.<br />Two RCTs comparing oral versus vaginal misoprostol for the induction of labour have been reported since this systematic review was published. In 2007, Rasheed et al. concluded that the vaginal was more efficacious than the oral route by requiring fewer doses and having a reduced need for oxytocin (310 participants). However, the vaginal formulation was associated with an increased incidence of hyperstimulation. In 2008, Cheng et al. compared titrated oral with vaginal misoprostol (207 participants). A higher proportion of the women receiving titrated oral misoprostol had a vaginal delivery within 12 hrs (74%) compared to the other group (26%). There were no cases of hyperstimulation in the titrated oral group compared with 11% in the vaginal group (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.61).<br />In 2007, Nasser et al. showed that sublingual misoprostol was associated with a higher patient satisfaction rate compared to a similar dose of vaginal misoprostol.  Sublingual misoprostol was associated with less pain at pelvic examinations, a better than expected labour experience, a positive attitude to induction in subsequent pregnancies and a preference for the same route in subsequent pregnancies. The mean number of doses, as well as the oxytocin augmentation, uterine hyperstimulation, induction to delivery interval and Caesarean section rates were similar between the two groups.</p>\n<p><br />The safety and efficacy of vaginal misoprostol have been compared to dinoprostone in two recent RCTs (Calder et al. and Prager et al.). Misoprostol is cheaper and easier to store than dinoprostone but its use for induction of labour is not licensed.  The latest NICE guidelines on induction of labour advise that misoprostol should only be offered as a method of inducing labour in women who have had an intrauterine fetal death or in the context of a clinical trial.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Provision of antenatal care<h3>3.1 Provision of antenatal care</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong></p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (Hatem et al., 2008) compared midwife-led antenatal care with other models, such as obstetrician-led and shared care, with respect to pregnancy outcomes.  Those women who were looked after primarily by midwives had a lower incidence of antenatal hospitalisation; were significantly more likely to feel in control during labour, achieve spontaneous vaginal delivery and start breastfeeding, and were less likely to have regional anaesthesia, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or experience fetal loss at less than 24 weeks.  There was no increased likelihood of any adverse outcomes in those under midwife-led care.  However, the authors warned  against assigning women to midwife-led care if they had medical or obstetric complications. </p>\n<p><br />Downe et al. (2009) performed a meta-synthesis to address the important and challenging problem of providing antenatal care for marginalised women in high-income countries.  The latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health revealed that women from specific socio-economic groups (e.g. black African women from deprived areas), and those who book late or who are infrequent attendees of antenatal care, are all at increased risk of maternal death. Only eight studies fulfilled the authors’ selection criteria (one from UK, one from Canada and six from the USA). The study looked at different groups of marginalised women (such as adolescents, ethnic minorities, low income, HIV-positive, drug abusers).  In terms of access to antenatal care, younger women were less likely to access care early as were women with chaotic lifestyles (for example those who are homeless or drug-abusers), and those who had feelings of indifference towards antenatal care and ignorance of its existence. Social factors come into play when sustaining care provision, such as travel costs, and satisfaction of the interaction with the healthcare worker appointments – especially if they were too rushed,  dismissive of problems, judgemental or culturally insensitive.   Women from marginalised groups, such as drug abusers and women with learning difficulties, had fears regarding what would happen to their baby following birth and so mistrusted the professionals.  Women whose cultural or religious beliefs were disregarded during appointments (e.g. a Muslim woman seeing a male doctor) were less likely to re-attend.  <br />A systematic review of 65 epidemiological studies showed that low birthweight, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality and congenital malformations in European countries were all significantly more common in immigrant compared to ‘native’ mothers (Bollini, Pampallona et al,. 2009).  In countries with strong integration policies, the increased risk of these adverse outcomes was less than in those countries with weak integration policies.</p>\n<p><br />Dennis and Kingston (2008) conducted a systematic review of telephone support compared to normal antenatal care on the subjects of smoking, preterm birth, low birthweight, breastfeeding and postpartum depression.   Fourteen trials were included, in which all telephone support given was proactive (the mother was phoned) and provided by various healthcare professionals, including lay-people in some studies.  The review suggested that proactive support helped increase the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (OR 1.45 95% CI 1.12-1.87) and continuation of all breastfeeding.  It may also help prevent relapse after smoking cessation (a significant result was found at 24 weeks postpartum  although not at any other time), but not cessation itself.  It also reduced the rate of low birthweight babies (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.63 – 0.97).  In one pilot study there was a decrease in depressive symptoms at 4 and 8 weeks post-partum.  There was no significant effect on preterm births.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>How, and by whom, should antenatal care be provided?</strong><br />Antenatal care in uncomplicated pregnancies should be midwife and GP-led. There should be continuity of care throughout the antenatal period from a small group of carers with whom the woman feels comfortable. A clear system of referral paths should be established. The care should be sensitive to the needs of individual women and the local community. </p>\n<p>Structured maternity records should be used for antenatal care and systems should be in place to ensure that women carry their own case notes (Cochrane Systematic Review 2004). Nulliparous women with an uncomplicated pregnancy should have ten appointments during their antenatal care schedule, parous women should have seven. A standardised national maternal record with an agreed minimum data set should be developed and used.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Support during the antenatal period<br /></strong>A randomised trial in Sweden with 1,700 participants (Berglund et al.) concluded in 2007 that psychosocial support and risk assessment in early pregnancy are improved by combining the perspectives of midwives and doctors: 758 mothers had a routine early pregnancy risk assessment by a doctor and 942 women had a planning conference between a midwife and doctor. The degree of agreement in risk registration between the two groups was found to be good for previous pregnancy complications and recommendations for a doctor’s consultation; fair for social problems, and poor for registration of symptoms and problems in the index pregnancy, including psychosocial aspects such as anxiety. </p>\n<p>A 2008 RCT with 68 participants in Thailand (Jareethum et al.) compared the satisfaction levels of antenatal care between healthy pregnant women who received short message service (SMS) via mobile phone for prenatal support, and those who did not. In the SMS using group, the confidence level was higher (p = 0.001) and the anxiety level was lower (p = 0.002) than the control group in the antenatal period; however, no difference in pregnancy outcomes were found.</p>\n<p>A 2006 RCT with 540 participants in Sweden (Ekstrom et al.) reported that mothers were more satisfied with emotional and information support after implementation of a process-oriented, breastfeeding training program for antenatal midwives and postnatal nurses that focused on providing continuity of care. The results lend support to health care professionals making every effort to have one face-to-face encounter to discuss breastfeeding with expectant mothers. </p>\n<p>In 2007 an RCT with 131 participants (Barlow et al.) reported that pregnant women in families at risk of abuse and neglect benefit from a weekly home visiting service from 6 months gestation to 12 months after delivery; statistically significant improvements were reported in maternal sensitivity and infant cooperativeness. </p>\n<p>An RCT with 117 women in 2003 (Cope et al.) reported that provision of additional material (particularly an audiotape) following a prenatal scan appears to minimise anxiety compared with standard practice. Participants with suspected fetal anomalies were randomised to four groups: one was given a consultation and ultrasound report; the other three groups had this standard information and either audiotapes and/or a non-technical letter. Patient recall of the consultation was not altered by these extra interventions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1. Bollini, P., Pampallona, S., Wanner, P., Kupelnick, B.

The information included below is reproduced from our 2008 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2008 AEU</strong></p>\n<p>Good communication between the healthcare professional and the pregnant woman is extremely important – it should be supplemented with appropriate and accessible written material.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women should be able to make an informed decision regarding all aspects of their antenatal care. In other words, women’s choice should be an integral part of the medical decision-making process. This is obviously important for research trials, especially in critical situations.  Kenyon et al. (2006) investigated women’s experiences of being recruited into a large multicenter RCT of antibiotics in pre-term labour. Most women were satisfied with the written and oral information provided by their health care professionals. However, it appeared that the stressful nature of the situation did decrease the women’s ability to understand the information fully, in particular trial design and practices. For example, many women believed that antibiotics were absolutely safe. The main motivation for trial participation was the possibility of an improved outcome for the baby.  The authors suggested further research on how governance arrangements for trials can protect participating women and suggested investigating the interaction between research candidates and recruiters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Antenatal education in the UK is mostly delivered individually by midwives and GPs, and in groups within antenatal classes. The authors state that the effects of general antenatal education for childbirth and/or parenthood remain unknown. A recent systematic review looked at the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. The authors found one RCT, which examined an educational intervention to increase vaginal birth after Caesarean section. Individual antenatal education did not increase the number of vaginal births after Caesarean section compared to routine information (Gagnon, 2006). However, a recent RCT demonstrated that a computer based decision aid for the mode of delivery among women with a previous caesarean section did increase vaginal delivery rates (Montgomery et al., 2007). A recent Cochrane review of RCTs found that the effects of structured group or individual antenatal classes are largely unknown due to a lack of studies (Gagnon et al., 2008). There is little evidence that antenatal class attendance changes birth outcomes e.g. mode of birth; however, parental knowledge is increased and most women view antenatal classes positively. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A decision aid for women with breech presentation at term resulted in increased knowledge and satisfaction, reduced decisional conflict, and no increase in anxiety compared to usual care (Nassar et al., 2007). Evidence shows that pregnant women undergoing prenatal testing for Down’s Syndrome perceive the risks of having an affected child and the risks of the diagnostic procedures, depending on their prenatal diagnostic test inclination, rather than the actual risks involved (Caughey et al., 2008). Clearly, effectively educating parents and communicating the actual risk is essential so that they can make informed decisions. Information leaflets are effective in increasing the knowledge of pregnant women about screening tests, as are decision aid techniques, although more information may decrease the uptake rate. Women have been found to prefer to receive information face-to-face rather than in other ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Antenatal education has been demonstrated to help cessation of smoking during pregnancy (Dornelas et al., 2006; Lumley et al., 2004) and to improve breastfeeding practice (Mattar et al., 2007),initiation and duration of breast feeding.. Compared with routine hospital care, one RCT showed that there is a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding if pregnant women have antenatal or postnatal education (Lin-Lin Su et al. 2008). On the other hand, another RCT found that additional breast feeding education mid-trimester could not be recommended as an effective strategy to increase breastfeeding initiation or duration compared with standard care in settings where breastfeeding initiation is already high (Forster et al., 2004). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One Australian cross sectional study found that prenatal information regarding Listeria was insufficient. Lower income, lower education, non-English speaking and unplanned pregnancy were associated with decreased knowledge of Listeria and increased consumption of high risk foods (Bondarianzadeh et al., 2007). There is also evidence that antenatal education regarding diet is effective in improving eating behaviours, although this is not linked with an improvement in pregnancy outcome. Providing information on safe alcohol consumption in pregnancy does not appear to alter practice, but it does improve knowledge about recommended safe levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

Isometric calf exercises, walking around the cabin and avoiding dehydration are also important considerations. It is recommended not to travel by air after the 36th week of pregnancy, and indeed most airlines will refuse to carry women whose pregnancy is past this date – after the 28th week women should carry a letter from their doctor or midwife, confirming good health, normal pregnancy and the expected delivery date.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a car, it is important that the three-point seat belt should be used correctly: it should be worn above and below the abdomen, never across it. One study found that approximately half of fetal deaths from car accident trauma would have been prevented if all the pregnant women had worn a seat belt in the recommended position (Klinich et al. 2008). When travelling abroad, especially to countries in which vaccinations are required, it is recommended to consult the midwife or doctor well in advance of the trip.  The NICE guidelines give a short overview of the recommendations for the use of the most common vaccines during pregnancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Antenatal and Pregnancy Care - Ultrasound assessment in the second and third trimester<h3>4.3 Ultrasound assessment in the second and third trimester</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment of Cervical Length</strong> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU <br /></strong>Cervical length, measured by trans-vaginal ultrasonography, can be used to predict spontaneous preterm birth.  Crane and Hutchins performed a meta-analysis of studies investigating the role of measuring cervical length in helping to predict spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women with an increased risk of preterm birth (previous preterm delivery, cervical excision, uterine anomaly)  (Crane, Hutchens et al. 2008).   They showed that a cervical length of less than 25mm was associated with a significant increase in the likelihood ratio of a spontaneous preterm delivery (&lt;35 weeks).  This is the first meta-analysis to confirm that cervical length is predictive of preterm delivery  in asymptomatic women with a history of spontaneous preterm delivery.  <br />A Cochrane review by Berghella et al. investigated whether measurement of cervical length reduces the risk of preterm birth.   Analysing three trials of singleton pregnancies with preterm labour, there was no statistically significant difference in the preterm birth rate whether the cervical length was known or not. A study in twin pregnancies did not show any significant difference between the groups but the sample size was small (n=125). The authors suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend this test in screening either symptomatic or asymptomatic women (Berghella 2009) but that further research is warranted.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>There is a known relationship between cervical shortening and preterm birth. <br />A randomised, prospective, longitudinal study by Hebbar and Samjhana in 2006 (200 participants) showed that the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery increases steeply as cervical length decreases, and that cervical length determined by ultrasound in mid-trimester has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of 77%, 95%, 56% and 98% respectively, at a cut off value of 2.5cm.<br />A 2004 RCT  (Tsoi et al. 253 participants) concluded that ultrasound measurement of cervical length helps to avoid over-diagnosis of preterm labour in women with preterm contractions and intact membranes. A cervical length of 15mm was found to be useful in predicting who would go into labour within the next 7 days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound and maternal-fetal bonding</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>A small randomised study in 2005 (Rustico et al.) allocated 100 women to two groups, one of which received 2D and the other 4D ultrasound. The scans were performed in the second or third trimester. Although more women undergoing 4D ultrasound recognised details of their fetuses, no significant difference was reported in maternal attachment to their unborn child.<br />A similar study was carried out by Lapaire et al. in 2007 which randomised 60 women to either 2D or 3D ultrasound in the second or third trimester. Maternal preference for 3D ultrasound had no effect on maternal-fetal bonding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Routine ultrasound assessment and safety</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A Cochrane review involving 27,024 women investigated the effect of routine ultrasound after 24 weeks, in low-risk or unselected pregnancies (Bricker, Neilson et al. 2008).  Third trimester ultrasound was found to have no significant impact on antenatal, obstetric or neonatal interventions and no impact on morbidity. There was a trend towards increasing Caesarean section rates with screening but this was not statistically significant.<br />A systematic review and meta-analysis (Torloni et al., 2009) considered the safety of ultrasound in pregnancy. They considered the use of ultrasound against a variety of adverse maternal and infant outcomes, including impaired growth, neurological development, non right-handedness, intellectual performance and malignancies. They conclude that ultrasound in pregnancy is safe but did report a weak association with left-handedness in males (odds ratio 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.54). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>In 2005 Bly et al. conducted a literature review to determine the balance of benefits, harms and costs of ultrasound during pregnancy. The review recommended that ultrasound should be used sparingly and carefully due to the potential for tissue heating, which may cause damage. Circumstances in which tissue heating was more likely or more dangerous were reported to be: scanning during the first trimester with a long trans-vesical path; bone being in the focal zone, and scanning poorly-perfused and embryonic tissues, and febrile mothers. The higher energy forms of ultrasound, in particular Doppler, were recommended to be avoided completely in the first trimester, and not to be used more than medical advice dictates.</p>\n<p>A routine third trimester ultrasound scan is currently not offered in low-risk pregnancies. This practice is based mainly on results of a Cochrane meta-analysis published in 2001 which concluded that \"routine late pregnancy ultrasound in low-risk or unselected populations does not confer benefit on mother or baby”. However, in 2008, Le Ray et al. pointed out that the meta-analysis included trials of outdated techniques and ultrasound examinations performed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and that none of the trials evaluated the effect of third trimester scanning on perinatal outcome when ultrasound resulted in an altered perinatal management plan. Their assessment of the evidence called into question the contemporary validity of the conclusion of the meta-analysis’ conclusions and it has recently been withdrawn by the authors. </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound diagnosis of placenta praevia</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU<br /></strong>No new evidence available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-2009 Evidence<br /></strong>If a routine ultrasound offered in the second trimester reveals the placenta to be low lying, a further scan should be performed in the third trimester. If the placenta is in a normal position in the second trimester, there is no evidence that ultrasound scanning in the third trimester improves the outcome for mother or baby. </p>\n<p>A Canadian review of trans-vaginal ultrasound for the diagnosis of placenta praevia (Oppenheimer, 2007) advised that if the placental edge reaches, or overlaps with the internal os between 18 and 24 weeks gestation, a follow-up ultrasound in the third trimester should be performed. The latest NICE Antenatal Care Guidelines (March 2008) recommend the repeat scan to be at 32 weeks. The review by Oppenheimer also noted the greater accuracy of trans-vaginal, compared with trans-abdominal, ultrasound. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Uterine Artery Doppler Ultrasonography</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />A systematic review and meta-analysis (Cnossen et al., 2008) looked at the use of uterine artery Doppler to predict pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). They found that abnormal uterine waveforms predict both pre-eclampsia and IUGR, but have a stronger association with the former. The most predictive measure for pre-eclampsia is a raised pulsatility index combined with  notching in the second trimester.  The authors advise that these indices should be used in clinical practice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment of amniotic fluid volume</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU</strong><br />The amniotic fluid index (AFI) and single deepest vertical pocket (SDVP) are two non-invasive ultrasound methods of measuring amniotic fluid volume.  Nabhan et al. (2009) performed a meta-analysis of four trials (n=2,185) comparing the two methods: the AFI diagnosed significantly more cases of oligohydramnios and resulted in significantly more interventions (induction of labour and Caesarean sections for fetal distress).   However, they found no evidence that either method reduced the occurrence of adverse peripartum outcomes.   Therefore, the authors recommended that the SDVP is the method of choice for assessment of amniotic fluid volume.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> <br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Dysmenorrhoea - Aetiology<p><strong>4. Aetiology</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong> </p>\n<p>Primary dysmenorrhoea is said to occur in the absence of obvious underlying disease [Cameron, 1999; Rees, 2003].</p>\n<p><br />• Primary dysmenorrhoea usually dates from the onset of ovulatory cycles, which occur within 6–12 months of menarche [Rees, 2003].<br />• Prostaglandins in menstrual fluid cause uterine hypercontractility: excessive contractions and high resting myometrial tone. Blood flow is reduced during contractions, which probably results in ischaemic pain. The roles of vasopressin and leukotrienes are unclear, but elevated levels are found in women with dysmenorrhoea [Lumsden and Norman, 1997; Rees, 2003; French, 2005].<br />• Factors associated with primary dysmenorrhoea include the following: [Sundell et al, 1990; Parazzini et al, 1994;Harlow and Park, 1996; Montero et al, 1996; Alonso and Coe, 2001; Wang et al, 2004]:<br />o Early menarche (12 years or younger)<br />o Menstrual cycles greater than 35 days long<br />o Menstruation for 7 days or longer<br />o Increased body weight and obesity<br />o Smoking<br />o Stress, anxiety, depression, and disruption of social support networks<br />o Attempts to lose weight (associated with increased menstrual pain, independent of body mass index)<br />o Alcohol may reduce the risk of dysmenorrhoea, although the pain is likely to be more severe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secondary dysmenorrhoea implies there is underlying pelvic pathology.</p>\n<p><br />• Later age of onset than primary dysmenorrhoea; usually 30-45 years old [Cameron, 1999].<br />• Causes include the following: [Dawood, 1990; Rees, 2003; Nasir and Bope, 2004]:<br />o Adenomyosis<br />o Cervical stenosis (e.g. after uterine or cervical surgery)<br />o Congenital malformations <br />o Endometrial polyps<br />o Endometriosis<br />o Fibroids <br />o Imperforate hymen<br />o Intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)<br />o Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)<br />o Ovarian tumours<br />• How the underlying pathology causes pain is not always clear. Abnormal prostaglandin production may be involved in women with an IUCD, and those with PID, adenomyosis or endometriosis [Lumsden and Norman, 1997].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p>Alonso, C. and Coe, C.L.

Definition and prevalence</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Definition<br /></strong>Dysmenorrhoea is cyclical, lower abdominal or pelvic pain, which may also radiate to the back and thighs, occurring before or during menstruation, or both. Diagnosis is usually by history with negative pelvic evaluation findings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Prevalence<br /></strong>The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea in adolescent girls ranges from 43–93%; it is 4–23% for severe dysmenorrhoea in the same population [Klein and Litt, 1981; Svanberg and Ulmsten, 1981; Andersch and Milsom, 1982; Wilson and Keye, 1989; Robinson et al, 1992; Harlow and Park, 1996; Campbell and McGrath, 1997; Davis and Westhoff, 2001].</p>\n<p><br />Discrepancies in prevalence rates are due to differences in the ages of the study populations and the definitions used.<br />In one Australian study, only 18% adolescent girls consulted a doctor about dysmenorrhoea, although 53% of those affected said it limited their activities [Hillen et al, 1999].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p>Andersch, B. and Milsom, I.

Further investigations and follow-up</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong> </p>\n<p>In a woman with a diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea, consider referral to a gynaecologist if she is not responding to treatment with NSAIDs and/or COCs, or if none of these treatments are suitable. A trial period of six months is usually sufficient to see an improvement in the majority of patients. </p>\n<p><br />Between 10% and 20% of women who present with apparent primary dysmenorrhoea are unresponsive to standard drug treatments. Some of these women may have secondary dysmenorrhoea and require appropriate investigations [Rees, 2003].</p>\n<p><br />Women with suspected secondary dysmenorrhoea should be referred to a gynaecologist in the following cases: <br /><br />• Abnormal findings on examination<br />• Severe symptoms<br />• Additional gynaecological symptoms<br />• Failure to respond to analgesics and/or COCs</p>\n<p><br />Finding an underlying cause usually requires specialist investigations, such as laparoscopy to exclude endometriosis. Treatment should be targeted at the underlying cause.</p>\n<p><br />The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that the following women should be referred [NICE, 2005]:</p>\n<p><br />• If there are clinical features suggestive of cervical cancer - urgently refer.<br />• If there is persistent inter-menstrual bleeding and pelvic examination is negative - consider urgent referral.<br />• If there is a palpable abdominal or pelvic mass on examination that is not obviously uterine fibroids nor of gastrointestinal or urological origin:<br />o Refer urgently for an ultrasound, and if the scan is suggestive of cancer an urgent referral should be made.<br />o If urgent ultrasound is not available, urgently refer.<br />Follow-up advice<br />Primary dysmenorrhoea:<br />• Ask the woman to return after 2–3 months if symptoms are not controlled. Between 10 and 20% of women who present with apparent primary dysmenorrhoea are unresponsive to standard drug treatments.<br />• Some of these women may have secondary dysmenorrhoea and require appropriate investigations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p>Rees, M.C.P.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Dysmenorrhoea - Management<p><strong>7. Management of dysmenorrhoea</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General Management</strong></p><strong>\n<p><br /></p></strong>Explain what the condition is and its benign nature. This may be all that is required, particularly in women with mild symptoms.\n<p><br />Enquire into factors that have been associated with dysmenorrhoea:</p>\n<p><br />• Smoking: advise women who smoke that dysmenorrhoea is more common and severe in smokers, but that it is not known whether stopping smoking improves symptoms [Sundell et al, 1990; Parazzini et al, 1994]. <br />• Weight: advise women that being overweight is associated with increased prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhoea [Harlow and Park, 1996]. However, it is unclear if weight loss improves symptoms: a cross-sectional survey of adolescent girls found that attempting to lose weight was associated with an increased incidence of menstrual pain [Montero et al, 1996]. See the CKS topic on Obesity.<br />• Alcohol: although alcohol is associated with a decreased prevalence, it is associated with more severe pain if dysmenorrhoea occurs [Parazzini et al, 1994; Harlow and Park, 1996]. See the CKS topic on Alcohol - problem drinking.<br />• Stress: stress, anxiety, depression and lack of social support have all been associated with dysmenorrhoea [Alonso and Coe, 2001; Wang et al, 2004].</p>\n<p><br />IUCDs can cause dysmenorrhoea and may require removal if adequate pain relief is not provided by analgesics [Smith, 1993]. However, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system reduces dysmenorrhoea and is an alternative if an IUCD is still desired [Luukkainen and Toivonen, 1995; Baldaszti et al, 2003].</p>\n<p><br />Tubal ligation: a cross-sectional analysis of 976 women, aged 36–44, found no difference in dysmenorrhoea in women with or without a history of tubal ligation [Harlow et al, 2002].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Non-drug treatments</strong></p>\n<p><br />Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): the available evidence suggests TENS is effective treatment and may represent a suitable alternative for women who prefer not to use medication, or wish to minimize their use of analgesics.<br />Acupuncture: the available evidence for acupuncture, though promising, remains very limited and its effectiveness is difficult to assess.</p>\n<p><br />Exercise: although it is often advocated, there is conflicting evidence over whether exercise improves dysmenorrhoea.<br />Dietary supplements: some women may prefer to try dietary supplements first before COCs or NSAIDs; however, they have not been shown to be of benefit [Proctor and Murphy, 2001].<br /></p>\n<p>A Cochrane review (search date to August 2001) found that high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was more effective than placebo at pain relief in primary dysmenorrhoea [Proctor et al, 2002]. Low-frequency TENS was no more effective than placebo.</p>\n<p><br />A Cochrane review (search date to August 2001) found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain in primary dysmenorrhoea [Proctor et al, 2002].</p>\n<p><br />The evidence that exercise may reduce the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhoea is limited and based on studies with methodological flaws and contradictory results [Golomb et al, 1998].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 Annual Evidence Update</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise: A recent systematic review concluded that there was still insufficient that exercise is likely to be effective in reducing primary dysmenorrhoea and that evidence from a large RCT is required (Daley 2008). </p>\n<p><br />Acupuncture: A systematic review of 32 trials found there is no convincing evidence for the use of acupuncture in primary dysmenorrhoea.  The studies are of low methodological quality and small sample size. There is, therefore, an urgent need for randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of acupuncture (Yang et. al., 2008). </p>\n<p><br />Paracematol and caffeine: This single-dose, placebo-controlled study showed that caffeine acts as an analgesic adjuvant, enhancing the efficacy of paracetamol in dysmenorrhoea (Ali et. al., 2007).  </p>\n<p><br />Complementary medicine: This RCT showed Psidii guajavae folium extract appears to be useful in the management of primary dysmenorrhoea (Doubova et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong> </p><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /?><p><p><strong>Drug Treatments</strong></p><strong>\n<p><br /></p></strong>Paracetamol has some evidence of effectiveness and may provide adequate pain relief for women with mild symptoms.\n<p><br />• A systematic review investigated the efficacy of minor analgesics in relieving pain in primary dysmenorrhoea [Zhang and Li Wan Po, 1998].  <br /></p>\n<p>NSAIDs have good evidence of effectiveness from RCTs.<br /><br />• NSAIDs are inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and are thought to relieve dysmenorrhoea by decreasing uterine prostaglandin levels, resulting in reduced uterine contractility.<br />• A Cochrane review (search date to April 2003) found that NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea [Marjoribanks et al, 2003]. Aspirin was less effective than other NSAIDs, but otherwise no differences in efficacy between NSAIDs were detected. <br />• The same review found two trials comparing paracetamol with an NSAID in primary dysmenorrhoea [Marjoribanks et al, 2003]. No difference in pain relief was found, but the authors pointed out that the available evidence had little power to detect such differences.<br />COCs have evidence of effectiveness and are particularly useful if contraception is also required.</p>\n<p><br />• COCs are thought to relieve dysmenorrhoea by inducing endometrial thinning and inhibiting ovulation, resulting in low levels of uterine prostaglandins [Muse, 1990].<br />• The WHO recommends that COCs can be used from menarche [FFPRHC, 2004].<br />• A Cochrane review of COCs for primary dysmenorrhoea found insufficient evidence to prove that COCs are effective at relieving pain [Proctor et al, 2001b].<br />• However, two RCTs have been published since the Cochrane review which support a role for COCs in dysmenorrhoea [Hendrix and Alexander, 2002, Davis et al, 2005]</p>\n<p><br />Other hormonal treatments that can be tried include:</p>\n<p><br />• Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DepoProvera) results in amenorrhoea in most women within the first year of use and therefore can be a useful treatment for dysmenorrhoea [French, 2005]. However, where contraception is required in younger women with dysmenorrhoea, the preferred choice is a COC.<br />• The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is not licensed for dysmenorrhoea, but there is some evidence of benefit. It might be considered for a woman who needs long-term contraception, especially if menorrhagia is also a problem [Smith, 1993; Luukkainen and Toivonen, 1995].<br />•  Combining different treatments may be a useful option:<br />• Although no trials have specifically looked at the benefits of combining different treatments for dysmenorrhoea, such as an NSAID with a COC, this is a reasonable option if symptoms are not adequately controlled with either treatment alone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 Annual Evidence Update</strong> </p>\n<p><br />This study showed that a low dose COC was more effective in adolescent girls than placebo in reducing pain in moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhoea (MacDonald 2006). <br />This observational study demonstrated relief of dysmenorrhoea symptoms in a group of women using an oestrogen-free, desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive who had previously suffered oestrogen-related symptoms during COC use for dysmenorrhoea (Ahrendt et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Further Treatments</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />Menstrual cycle suppressants, such as progestogens, danazol (unlicensed indication), and GnRH agonists (unlicensed indication), are occasionally used to treat severe primary dysmenorrhoea unresponsive to other treatments.</p>\n<p><br />• Although there is trial evidence of effectiveness for the treatment of endometriosis-related menstrual pain, there are no RCTs in primary dysmenorrhoea.</p>\n<p><br />Other drugs that might be considered include anticholinergic antispasmodics, glyceryl trinitrate, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-agonists, although the evidence to support their use is limited [French, 2005].</p>\n<p><br />Surgery has been used to treat dysmenorrhoea when medical treatments have failed.</p>\n<p><br />• However, it is not standard practice in the UK for surgical treatment to be offered for primary dysmenorrhoea.<br />• The aim is to reduce uterine pain by interrupting cervical sensory nerve fibres.<br />o Uterine nerve ablation (UNA) involves the transection of the uterosacral ligaments at their insertion into the cervix.<br />o Presacral neurectomy (PSN) involves the total removal of the presacral nerves lying within the boundaries of the interiliac triangle.<br />A Cochrane review (search date to 1998) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea regardless of cause [Proctor et al, 2005]. Further trials are needed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 Annual Evidence Update</strong></p>\n<p>A systematic review of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in dysmenorrhoea reached a similar conclusion. The evidence for nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea is limited; well powered RCTs are needed (Latthe et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p><br />This study showed that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), can relieve primary dysmenorrhoea. The authors suggest SERMs may constitute a therapeutic option in selected groups of patients such as BRCA carriers, breast cancer survivors or those who fail to respond to NSAIDs or COCs (Pierzynski et. al., 2006). </p>\n<p><br />In a three-way, crossover study, aceclofenac and naproxen provided better pain relief in primary dysmenorrhoea than placebo (Letzel et. al., 2006). Selective COX-2 inhibitors may also be effective treatments. In a small crossover study, etoricoxib provided better pain relief, less menstrual blood loss and fewer side-effects than mefenamic acid in primary dysmenorrhoea (Nor Azlin et. al., 2008), and lumiracoxib relieved pain better than placebo in two RCTs (Daniels et. al., 2008). </p>\n<p><br />This RCT showed that glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches relieved primary dysmenorrhoea; however, headaches reduced its efficacy and tolerability (Modares et. al., 2008).<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CKS Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The following treatments have been proposed as treatments for dysmenorrhoea, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use.</p>\n<p><br />• Guaifenesin is an expectorant that has been studied in dysmenorrhoea due to its proposed effects on cervical dilatation and cervical mucus thinning. It was found to be no more effective than placebo in one RCT [Marsden et al, 2004].<br />• Leukotriene antagonists have been suggested as a treatment, because elevated leukotrienes levels are found in women with dysmenorrhoea [Lumsden and Norman, 1997; Rees, 2003; French, 2005]. However, Montelukast was no more effective than placebo in one small RCT [Harel et al, 2004].<br />• Spinal manipulation has been proposed as a treatment. One hypothesis is that mechanical problems with certain vertebrae affect pelvic sympathetic nerves, resulting in vasoconstriction of uterine blood vessels and dysmenorrhoea. However, a Cochrane review (search date to March 2004) found that high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation was no more effective than sham manipulation, although it was possibly more effective than no treatment [Proctor et al, 2001a].<br />• Behavioural therapy (both physical and psychological coping strategies) has been poorly studied, but there is insufficient evidence of benefit: a Clinical Evidence review (search date to July 2004) found a RCT showing that only women with spasmodic dysmenorrhoea experienced significantly less pain with relaxation compared with group discussion or waiting list control [Proctor and Farquhar, 2005].<br />• Dietary supplements alone are not recommended.  A Cochrane review (search date to October 2000) reported that there was insufficient evidence to recommend their use in the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea [Proctor and Murphy, 2001]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 Annual Evidence Update</strong></p>\n<p>This systematic review concluded that there is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective in dysmenorrhoea.  However, the results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials (Proctor et. al., 2007). <br /></p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Ahrendt HJ, Karckt U, Pichl T, Mueller T, Ernst U.

Search methodology</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 2006 CKS guideline on dysmenorrhoea was identified and used the basis for this Annual Evidence Update. The original search carried out for the CKS guideline included publications published up to 2005. We therefore searched the literature from 2006-2009 to ensure that we identified all relevant papers published since the CKS guideline was written.   </p>\n<p>Databases searched included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID Medline, OVID Embase and EbscoHost CINAHL.  Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the SIGN Embase Systematic Review filter, the SIGN Embase RCT filter, the Medline Systematic Review CRD filter, the Medline SIGN RCT filter and the SIGN CINAHL Systematic Review and SIGN CINAHL RCT filters.  The search terms used included dysmenorrhoea; period pain; menstrual cramp; cyclic pain; monthly pain and these were combined with the limits ‘English in language’ and restricted to 2006 to 2009.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of relevant papers identified were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document.  Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition.  When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following summary document is based on the existing CKS guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available.  These data are cited.  Readers are referred to the CKS guideline for the citation details of the older studies.   </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=307301&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=6082\"><strong>Link back to AEU home page.</strong> </a></p>\n<p><br /> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Clinical features and diagnosis<p><strong>5. The clinical features and diagnosis of endometriosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>The following symptoms have been associated with endometriosis:</p>\n<p>• Severe dysmenorrhoea (painful periods)<br />• Deep dyspareunia (pain on intercourse)<br />• Chronic non-menstrual pain<br />• Pain at the time of ovulation<br />• Dyschezia (pain on defaecation, especially at the time of menstruation)<br />• Cyclical or perimenstrual symptoms, affecting the bowel or bladder, with or without abnormal bleeding or pain<br />• Subfertility (difficulty conceiving for more 12 months)<br />• Chronic fatigue</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the predictive value of any one symptom or set of symptoms is uncertain because of the overlap with other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal disorders (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006.). The difficulties inherent in interpreting such symptoms contribute to the well-recognised delay of up to 10 years between the onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who present with such symptoms, especially if there is a cyclical component.  A history and pelvic examination should be performed. There is evidence to suggest that performing the examination during menstruation helps to make the diagnosis, although many women are reluctant to be examined at that time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The pelvic examination may be entirely normal, but features suggestive of endometriosis include:</p>\n<p>• Generalised pelvic tenderness <br />• Fixed, retroverted uterus (due to adhesions and/or deeply infiltrating disease) <br />• Tender uterosacral ligaments (nodules may also be palpable) <br />• Enlarged ovaries<br />• Seeing lesions/nodules in the vagina or on the cervix</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds but it can only be confirmed on visual inspection of the peritoneal cavity at laparoscopy.  Histological confirmation of at least one lesion represents ideal practice, although if an endometrioma &gt; 4 cms in diameter or deeply infiltrating disease is present, histology <strong>should be obtained</strong> to exclude rare instances of malignancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disease severity should be assessed by documenting in detail the type, location and extent of all lesions and adhesions found at surgery.  Ideal practice is to record the findings on video or DVD as well. Disease severity can be assessed quantitatively using a classification system such as the one developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  However, there is no correlation between such systems and the type or severity of pain symptoms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with an approximately 3% risk of minor complications, such as nausea or shoulder-tip pain, and a risk of major complications, such as bowel perforation, of between 0.6 to 1.8 per 1,000 procedures. Therefore, a non-invasive test would be clinically useful. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following tests have been used with varying degrees of success:</p>\n<p>• Serum CA-125 (a test for ovarian cancer) – levels may be elevated in endometriosis but the test has little diagnostic value and is not recommended.<br />• Trans-vaginal ultrasound – a useful tool to make and exclude the diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma, but it has limited value in diagnosing peritoneal disease. Two studies have proposed different ways of performing ultrasound to detect deeply infiltrating endometriosis: transvaginal ‘tenderness guided’ ultrasound with 91% sensitivity and 89% specificity for vaginal disease, and 74% sensitivity and 88% specificity for rectovaginal disease (Guerriero et. al., 2008); transrectal ultrasound in rectovaginal disease with a positive post-test prevalence probability of 93% (Griffiths et. al., 2008). The authors advocating the use of transrectal ultrasound concluded that pre-operative scanning for rectovaginal endometriosis strongly predicts the need for extensive laparoscopic dissection and potential bowel resection.<br />• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – there is insufficient evidence at present regarding its diagnostic potential; however, MRI and other imaging modalities (e.g. transrectal ultrasound, IVP, barium enema) may have a role in defining disease extent in deeply infiltrating endometriosis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a woman with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis wants treatment without a definitive diagnosis, the options include counselling, analgesia and hormonal medication to reduce menstrual flow (e.g. progestagens or COC). It is unclear whether the COC should be taken conventionally, continuously or in a tricycle regimen in such circumstances.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist may be taken, although this is an expensive option and concerns exist about the effects on bone mineral density (BMD). It is also argued that establishing the correct diagnosis at laparoscopy before initiating therapy with significant short- and long-term side effects is the preferred approach (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Guerriero S, Ajossa S, Gerada M, Virgilio B, Angioni S, Melis GB.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Epidemiology and aetiology<p><strong>3. Epidemiology and aetiology of endometriosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>No new evidence was identified by our updated literature search on this topic. The information below has been reproduced from our 2008 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is difficult to define the epidemiology of endometriosis precisely because a surgical procedure is required to make the diagnosis definitively. However, the following are best estimates: </p>\n<p>• Endometriosis affects 10-15% of all women in the reproductive years<br />• The incidence is 40-60% in women with dysmenorrhoea and 20-30% in those with subfertility.<br />• Risk factors include a heavy menstrual load (due to short cycle length and long duration of flow).<br />• Current/recent use of the combined oral contraceptive (COC), smoking and exercise may be protective.<br />• The sisters and daughters of affected women are 6-9 times more likely to develop endometriosis than women in the general population.<br />• Endometriosis is a considerable burden in terms of both direct and indirect healthcare costs, and its affect on quality of life (Gao et. al., 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the aetiology of endometriosis. The most dominant theory is retrograde menstruation (the passage of viable endometrial cells along the fallopian tubes into the pelvis at the time of menstruation).</p>\n<p>• However, retrograde menstruation occurs commonly in all women. <br />A recent systematic review found evidence supporting the retrograde menstruation theory. A significantly higher prevalence of endometriotic lesions was found in the right subphrenic area.  The authors explain this by the fact that peritoneal fluid which is transported clockwise is trapped in the right hypochondrium by the falciform ligament (Vercellini et al., 2007).<br />• It is likely that aberrant function in related pathophysiological systems (e.g. immunity, cell clearance, angiogenesis) is responsible for the implantation and subsequent growth of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. <br />• The disease causes chronic inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cyst formation.<br />• Endometriosis has been associated in the past with various malignancies (e.g. ovarian cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). However, the data are inconclusive and the risks, if they exist, may not be clinically relevant (Somigliana et al., 2006). Another recent systematic review however, looked at causality versus bias for interpreting data demonstrating an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. They concluded that a causal relationship exists. However, the frequency of malignant transformation of endometriotic lesions into ovarian cancer is similar to that of eutopic endometrium (Vigano et al., 2007).<br />• A recent systematic review of the effect of food intake on endometriosis and dysmenorrhea revealed that there are no clear data supporting dietary recommendations. Some studies suggested that fish oil (n-3 oils) may reduce pain symptoms in endometriosis. The authors suggested further studies on that matter (Fjerbaek and Knudsen, 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Fjerbaek, A., Knudsen, U.B.

Introduction<br /></strong>by Stephen Kennedy, Clinical Reader/Head of Department, Nuffield Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, University of Oxford, who is trustee of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation.<br /></p>\n<p> <br />This is the third Endometriosis Annual Evidence Update. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The purpose of the second Evidence Update in March 2008 was to summarise and update the information contained in the guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists in 2006 and the European Society for Human Reproduction &amp; Embryology (ESHRE) in 2005.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We have continued the same approach in the 2009 update.  Here we provide a summary of the most up-to-date information about the investigation and management of endometriosis, obtained from the ESHRE guideline (updated in 2008) and our own search of data from high quality studies published in the last year.  References relating to new, relevant studies are provided in the text.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We hope that, in time, this NLH site will become the single portal for all health care professionals and women with endometriosis who require high quality information as an aid to clinical decision making.  We also hope that the information provided will improve standards of care throughout the UK.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lastly, it is important to mention that endometriosis was chosen as one of the first topics for the Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments (DUETS).  This on-line resource gives priority to identifying and publishing unanswered questions about the effects of treatments which have been asked by patients and clinicians, while also noting therapeutic uncertainties identified through systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and other formal mechanisms. Uncertainties that we have identified during our 2009 evidence update can be found listed in the <a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=307242&amp;tabID=289\">DUETs page</a> of this AEU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=307093&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=11472\">Link back to the AEU home page.</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Non-surgical management<p><strong>6. Non-surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis can be a chronic and debilitating disease, and few treatment options are entirely satisfactory. A cure may be achievable but for many women the medical and surgical treatments currently available have their limitations and symptoms often return after treatment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some women prefer not to take hormonal medication and are able to control their symptoms with analgesics. Although non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may relieve endometriosis-associated pain, there is too little evidence to assess their effectiveness. NSAIDs have significant side-effects (e.g. gastric ulceration and an anti-ovulatory effect when taken at mid-cycle). Other analgesics may be effective but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is some evidence that high frequency TENS, acupuncture, vitamin B1 and magnesium may help to relieve dysmenorrhoea, but it is not known whether such treatments are effective in endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhoea.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Women may rely on complementary medicine approaches (e.g. homeopathy, reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbal treatments). There is no evidence from RCTs to support the use of these therapies in endometriosis but it is generally recommended that they should not be ruled out if the woman feels that they could be beneficial to her overall pain management and/or quality of life, or work in conjunction with more traditional therapies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A recent systematic review of clinical and experimental data on the use of medicinal herbs in the treatment of endometriosis illustrated the lack of evidence from clinical studies (Wieser et al., 2007). However, the review highlighted the anti-inflammatory and pain-alleviating mechanisms of action of many herbal remedies and predicted that they might have a beneficial effect in endometriosis symptoms, if tested in an appropriate manner. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The options for hormonal treatment include the COC, progestagens, androgenic drugs and GnRH agonists; at appropriate doses, all suppress ovarian activity and menstruation. The levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS) also reduces endometriosis-associated pain (ESHRE 2007), and there are pilot data indicating that the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, may be effective although it is associated with significant bone mineral density (BMD) loss. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The principal hormonal drugs studied - COCs, danazol, gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and GnRH agonists – are equally effective at relieving endometriosis-associated pain when prescribed for 6 months but their side-effect and cost profiles differ. It is also important to bear in mind that:<br />• medical treatment does not always provide complete pain relief and some patients fail to respond at all. <br />• symptom recurrence is common following medical treatment. <br />• some side-effects limit long-term use and may produce poor compliance, e.g. androgenic side-effects associated with danazol (Selak et al., 2007). GnRH agonist therapy may result in up to 6% BMD loss in the first 6 months and the loss may not always be entirely reversible. However, the concomitant use of ‘add-back’ (oestrogen and progestagen) therapy protects against BMD loss at the lumbar spine during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment.<br />• the COC and Depo-Provera can be used long term, but danazol and GnRH agonists are usually restricted to 6 months; however, one study suggests 3 months with a GnRH agonist may be as effective as 6 months in terms of pain relief.<br />• although the COC and GnRH agonist therapy appear to be equally effective, the published studies are all small and no other treatments have been assessed as comparators (Davis et al., 2007). Therefore, there is a clear need to evaluate fully the role of the COC in managing symptoms associated with endometriosis.</p>\n<p>A small double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial has shown benefit in using a low dose combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) in reducing endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhoea (Harada et. al., 2008).  The study is helpful because of the uncertainty that exists about the effectiveness of the COCP in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=307361&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=12676\">DUETs</a>). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another small double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial found no benefit from using Infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, to treat endometriosis-associated pain (Koninckx et. al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is unclear whether hormonal treatment causes atrophy of endometriotic lesions, especially as the natural history of the untreated disease is unknown. The available data suggest that MPA and luteal phase dydrogesterone are ineffective, whereas gestrinone may be effective. The effects of danazol and the GnRH agonist, triptorelin, are inconclusive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References<br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>Harada T, Momoeda M, Taketani Y, Hoshiai H, Terakawa N.

Search methodology</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the literature search for the 2009 annual evidence update was to update the search carried out in 2008. Search strategies from the RCOG guideline and the ESHRE guideline were again replicated and the databases searched included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID Medline, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the SIGN Embase Systematic Review filter, the SIGN Embase RCT filter, the Medline Systematic Review CRD filter, the Medline SIGN RCT filter, the CINAHL SIGN Systematic Review and SIGN RCT filters.  The search terms used included endometriosis; endometriomas; endometriosis/diagnosis; endometriosis/drug therapy; endometriosis/complications; endometriosis/surgery and these were combined with the limits ‘English in language’ and restricted to March 2008 until January/February 2009.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of the identified papers were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained.  </p>\n<p><br />The following summary document is based on the existing guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited. Readers are referred to the RCOG guideline for the citation details of the older studies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=307093&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=11472\">Link back to AEU home page.</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Surgical management<p><strong>7. Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</strong></p>\n<p><br />There has been continuing uncertainty about the best surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas to prevent cyst and symptom recurrence (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=239111&amp;tabID=289\">DUETs</a>), as well as its overall effect on quality of life (<a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=302659&amp;tabID=289\">DUETs</a>).</p>\n<p><br />A Cochrane review update is therefore helpful as it concluded that excisional surgery for endometriomas provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to cyst recurrence and recurrence of pain symptoms (Hart et. al., 2008). Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of dysmenorrhea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06-0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08 CI 0.01-0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02-0.56), a reduced cyst recurrence rate (OR 0.41 CI 0.18-0.93) and a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05-0.79) than surgery to ablate the endometrioma. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hormonal suppression either before or after surgery for endometriosis is associated with benefit (Yap) A RCT with five year follow-up is therefore helpful as it concluded that adjuvant treatment with a GnRH agonist, following conservative surgery for Stage III-IV endometriosis, is not superior to expectant management in terms of preventing symptom or cyst recurrence (Loverro et al., 2008). </p>\n<p>A small RCT also found that the use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery for endometriosis improved pain scores at 2 and 3 months follow-up compared to conservative surgery only. They suggested prolonged use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery may improve long-term outcomes after surgical treatment (Kamencic et. al., 2008).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Uncertainty has always existed in the minds of clinicians and patients regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy for endometriosis. Unfortunately, the results of a recent Cochrane review add little to the evidence base as only two small RCTs were identified, which suggested that HRT can result in pain and disease recurrence (Al Kadri et. al., 2009).  However, the authors concluded that the evidence is not strong enough to advocate depriving severely symptomatic patients of HRT and there is a need for more RCTs. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2099 AEU References<br /></strong>Al Kadri H, Hassan S, Al-Fozan HM, Hajeer A.

Until quite recently, the treatment options were quite limited which partly explains why hysterectomy rates were so high in the developed world.  The treatment options now, however, are considerable; as a result, clinicians and patients alike benefit from having access to high quality information about the effectiveness of the treatments available, as well as their associated complications and side-effects.<br /> <br />In January 2007, NICE produced an excellent guideline summarising the best available evidence, which was the basis for the first Annual Evidence Update on HMB hosted by NHS Evidence - women's health.<br /> <br />This third Annual Evidence Update on HMB builds on the accumulated knowledge-base and provides an up-to-date summary of the latest evidence that has been subject to rigorous selection criteria.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please use the links at the top of this page to access different aspects of the knowledge week.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women<p><strong>3. Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Definition of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)</em> <br />HMB is highly subjective and current objective measures of HMB are not practical in clinical settings. There is also natural variability in menstrual cycle length, duration of menstruation and blood loss within the population. </p>\n<p>HMB should be defined as excessive menstrual loss which interferes with the woman’s physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms. Any interventions should aim to improve quality of life measures. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of HMB</em> <br />The prevalence of HMB has been studied in a number of countries and clinical settings through a variety of objective and subjective measures, resulting in a wide range of estimates. <br />Studies have suggested that approximately 10% of reproductive aged women have objective evidence of HMB; using subjective measures (self-reported information), the figure is approximately 30% (Lui et al., 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Risk Factors for increased menstrual bleeding</em> <br />Multiple factors, including increasing age, presence of uterine fibroids and racial group have been associated with an increased risk of HMB. However, their role in causality and the effects of modifying them remain uncertain. </p>\n<p>Psychological and sociocultural factors can influence a woman’s response to menstrual blood loss, and thus must be evaluated during the consultation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of uterine pathology</em> <br />The majority of women have no uterine pathology as the cause of their HMB. <br />The most commonly found pathologies are uterine fibroids (approximately 30% of women) and polyps (approximately 10% of women). </p>\n<p>Pre-malignant and malignant pathology are rare in women presenting with HMB who have undergone investigations. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Impact of HMB on quality of life</em> <br />It is important to recognise the major impact that HMB has on a woman’s health related quality of life (HRQoL). Evidence suggests that HMB impacts on social interaction and is associated with higher unemployment and absence from work, although it may not to be perceived by women to affect work performance. Interventions should focus on improving quality of life as opposed to focusing on menstrual blood loss. </p>\n<p>There is at present no specific HRQoL measure for HMB. Previous evidence suggests that current HRQoL measures, including Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), are not specific enough to reflect all of the HRQoL issues facing women with HMB. HMB specific quality of life measures need to be developed. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A systematic review evaluated the evidence relating to HRQoL, as well as health care costs (Lui et al., 2007). SF-36 scores from eight RCTs were included in a meta-analysis. Results suggested that women with abnormal uterine bleeding have HRQoL below the 25th percentile for the general female population. Most significantly affected areas of life were physical and emotional functioning affecting work productivity and other daily activities.  Sixteen studies using other validated HRQoL instruments found abnormal uterine bleeding to be associated with psychological morbidity, diminished sexual functioning and adverse effects on social, professional and family life. <br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A new paper (Frick et al 2008) has highlighted the importance of HMB on quality of life, as well as addressing financial implications of menorrhagia. Women awaiting surgical treatment for menorrhagia were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their HRQoL, and financial considerations, including costs of sanitary protection and time off work. This study shows the reduction in quality of life measures faced by these women, as well as demonstrating that expensive surgical treatments (such as hysterectomy) may be cost effective when medical treatments for menorrhagia have failed. </p>\n<p>A further paper (Shankar 2008) has also highlighted the reduction in quality of life suffered by women with HMB. It summarises a number of papers which have used tools such as the SF-36 to demonstrate a reduction in scores across all aspects of HRQoL in these women. </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>Frick KD, Clark MA, Steinwachs DM, Langenberg P, Stovall D, Munro MG, Dickersin K; STOP-DUB Research Group.

Search strategies devised last year, based on those used by NICE, were revised and re-run for May 2008 to April 2009.  The databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, OVID Medline, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. </p>\n<p>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted. The search terms used included menorrhagia; hypermenorrhoea; menometrorrhagia; metromenorrhagia; menstrual bleed; heavy periods; heavy menses; menstruation; heavy blood loss; dysfunctional uterine bleeding. These were combined with terms to filter for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs, limited to ‘English in language’. </p>\n<p>The abstracts of the 328 papers identified were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this update. After sifting, 26 papers were identified as relevant and the full-text was obtained; similarly, for other papers if doubt existed about the appropriateness of the data. After examining the full-text of the 26 papers, 7 papers were deemed to be relevant and were included in the AEU summaries. The articles were good systematic reviews and RCTs, and less robust studies where they illustrated a point of controversy or indicated a possible future direction for the management of the condition. </p>\n<p>The following summary documents are based on the existing NICE guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited. Readers are referred to the NICE guideline for the citation details of the older studies. <br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=315046&amp;tabID=289\">Link back to Annual Evidence Update Contents Page</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Treatment: Medical and surgical<p><strong>6. Treatment: Medical and surgical</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The range of treatments available for HMB is considerable. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Medical Treatment</strong> </p>\n<p>The NICE guideline outlines the order in which pharmaceutical treatments should be considered. The choice of treatment depends on a number of factors, particularly the woman’s desire to conceive. A second pharmacological treatment can be considered where a first has failed rather than immediate referral to surgery. </p>\n<p>(1) Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) (for at least 12 months). This leads to a highly significant decrease in menstrual blood loss (MBL), but its acceptability is limited by the high incidence of irregular bleeding and spotting that can persist for many months, as well as progestagenic side effects and persistent abdominal pain. Therefore, women should be advised to persevere with treatment for at least 6 cycles in order to see a benefit. Insertion of the LNG-IUS is easier in multiparous women although data do not suggest that side effects are more common in those who have not been pregnant. Oral treatment can be commenced whilst waiting for the device to be inserted. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A cost-utility study found that the most cost-effective treatment for HMB was the LNG-IUS, followed by ablation surgery as required (Clegg et al., 2007). In comparison with thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA), LNG-IUS was more effective at reducing MBL at 12 months, but had a slower onset of effect and was less tolerated because of side effects and continuing bleeding in a small proportion of patients (Shaw et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>(2) Tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (taken during menses). These lead to a decrease of up to 50% in MBL. Mefenamic acid is also useful in treating dysmenorrhoea. They are very safe and need only be taken for a few days each month. However, they should be stopped if there is no benefit after 3 cycles. The combined oral contraceptive pill is also an acceptable alternative.<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong><br />A Cochrane review indicated that whilst NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in treating HMB, they were not as effective as tranexamic acid, the LNG-IUS or danazol. NSAIDs are very well tolerated with no more adverse effects than placebo. Most trials have looked at the effects of mefenamic acid, but naproxen has been shown to be as effective albeit with increased gastrointestinal side effects (Lethaby et al., 2008). </p>\n<p>(3) Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or injected long acting progestagens (for at least 3 months). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A Cochrane review showed a significant decrease in MBL with a 21 day course of norethisterone. The decrease was significantly less than found with LNG-IUS; however, there were also fewer unpleasant side effects such as intermenstrual bleeding and breast tenderness. The long course of progestagens has yet to be compared with other medical therapies. The review confirmed that there was no place for oral progestagens given in the luteal phase only: they are significantly less effective at reducing MBL than tranexamic acid, danazol and the LNG-IUS (Lethaby et al, 2008). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A new RCT in perimenopausal women has confirmed that oral and intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate do reduce MBL, but that neither is as effective as the LNG-IUS (Kucuk 2008). </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Other Medical Treatments</strong></p>\n<p><em>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a)<br /></em>These are recommended prior to surgery for fibroids, or when other treatments for fibroids are contraindicated. If used for more than six months or if adverse effects are experienced (e.g. vasomotor symptoms), HRT ‘add-back’ therapy (e.g. tibolone) should be prescribed. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence <br /></strong>Add-back HRT - either started immediately or three months into GnRH-a treatment - has been shown in an RCT to reduce the fall in bone mineral density and vasomotor symptoms associated with GnRH-a without diminishing the effect on fibroid size. Patients taking tibolone reported a higher rate of vaginal bleeding than those taking GnRH-a alone, but this is thought to be less than that experienced before treatment (Morris et al., 2008). <br /><br /><br /><strong>2009 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A small RCT has been used to assess the effect of asoprisnil, a selective progesterone receptor modulating drug, on menorrhagia (Wilkens et al 2008). Women awaiting hysterectomy were given either asoprisnil or placebo for three months prior to their operation. Those taking aoprisnil reported a significant reduction in blood loss for the duration of treatment. Although the development of asoprisnil has been halted, this family of drugs may become clinically relevant in the future. <br /><br /></p>\n<p><em>Danazol</em> <br />The NICE guideline states that danazol should not be routinely used to treat HMB. <br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A Cochrane review found danazol to be effective in reducing MBL when compared with other available medical therapies (although it has never been compared with the LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid). It reported more adverse effects than the other drugs, particularly weight gain, acne, hirsutism and musculoskeletal pains, although this did not seem to affect its acceptability. Danazol has teratogenic effects, so women must be advised about the need for effective contraception. As yet, there is not enough evidence to recommend danazol as a treatment for HMB (Beaumont et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Surgical Treatment</strong> <br />Four surgical options are recommended in the NICE guideline: endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolisation (UAE), myomectomy and hysterectomy.</p>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Endometrial Ablation</strong></em> <br />This is recommended where no pathology is found, or where there are only small fibroids. It is not suitable if a woman wants to become pregnant in the future; women should be advised to avoid pregnancy and to use appropriate contraception. </p>\n<p>Commonly used methods include microwave endometrial ablation (MEA), thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA) and bipolar endometrial ablation. All methods have been subject to close scrutiny by the Health Technology Authority (HTA). </p>\n<p>TBEA has been compared to the Cavertherm thermal balloon and both were found to be equally effective (Brun et al., 2006). Ablation is probably less cost effective than the LNG-IUS although patients liked avoiding long-term therapy (Brown et al., 2006). It can also be performed successfully as an outpatient (Marsh et al., 2007). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A systematic review found TBEA to be an effective alternative treatment for menorrhagia resulting in reduced MBL and high satisfaction rates (Iavazzo et al., 2007).  In a comparison with the LNG-IUS, both methods demonstrated a reduction in MBL recorded by pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) and the number of days of bleeding at 12 months. The LNG-IUS had more of an effect than TBEA, but TBEA’s onset of effect was faster (Shaw et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>In an RCT comparing endometrial ablation and hysterectomy, both were effective at 24 months in solving the problem that led women to seek care (85% v. 94%), and in relieving bleeding, pain, fatigue and other symptoms. Hysterectomy was more effective at reducing bleeding, but associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and six times the infection rate of ablation. The re-operation risk at 5 years was 31% for the ablation group. (Dickersin et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A study comparing endometrial ablation in women with bleeding disorders found a significant reduction in MBL and no difference in the proportion of complications compared to controls. The advantage of this method over hysterectomy for women with bleeding disorders is to reduce the complication rate to that of the general population (El Nashar et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 5 year follow-up comparing TBEA and bipolar ablation found higher amenorrhoea rates and lower hysterectomy rates in the bipolar group. There was a significant improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in both groups (Kleijn et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 10 year follow-up of first generation ablation techniques (e.g. rollerball ablation) reported a 22% hysterectomy rate, reduced to 6% if the first treatment was successful at 2 years (Fürst et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Uterine Artery Embolisation (UAE)<br /></strong></em>UAE is an effective, safe and acceptable method of treating HMB (Writing Committee for the REST Trial participants, 2007). </p>\n<p>UAE is recommended as a first line treatment when fibroids are found with HMB. It potentially allows women to become pregnant in the future, but there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />An RCT found UAE to be a successful alternative to hysterectomy: 81% of patients had avoided hysterectomy 2 years after a technically successful UAE (77% on an intention to treat analysis). The two treatments had comparable effects on improvement of pain and bulk symptoms (Volkers et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 24 month follow-up RCT of UAE v. hysterectomy found that the treatments had a comparable adverse effect on ovarian reserve. The decrease in anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) - signalling ovarian activity - remained throughout follow-up and was higher than the decrease expected through ageing alone. The study concluded that women who wish to conceive in the future should only consider UAE after counselling (Hehenkamp et al., 2007). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A small double-blind RCT has highlighted the possibility that uterine artery occlusion may have benefits over embolisation: participants reported less procedural pain and required shorter hospital stays (Cunningham et al 2008). </p>\n<p>A 24 month follow-up of women randomly assigned to UAE or hysterectomy found significant improvement in HRQoL after both procedures, leading the authors to conclude that UAE is an effective alternative to hysterectomy (Hehenkamp et al 2008).</p>\n<p>A further study has found that UAE may be a more cost effective alternative to hysterectomy: on average,  UAE costs were 37% less than those associated with hysterectomy (Volkers 2008). </p>\n<p><br /><em><strong>Myomectomy</strong></em> (no new evidence)<br />Myomectomy is recommended when fibroids are found.  It potentially allows a woman to become pregnant in the future but, as with UAE, there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. </p>\n<p>In women with iron deficiency anaemia due to uterine fibroids, a single depot injection of the GnRH-a, goserelin acetate 10.8mg, with iron tablets 12 weeks before surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy), was shown to restore haemoglobin, alleviate fibroid symptoms, decrease uterine and fibroid size, and decrease bleeding more effectively than iron monotherapy. These data confirm the results of previous trials using multiple administrations of goserelin acetate and indicate that the same effects can be achieved with a single administration (Muneyyirci-Delale et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>An RCT looking at the role of cetrorelix acetate, a GnRH-a antagonist, for short term, pre-surgical treatment of fibroids, found that after one month of treatment, consisting of 4x10mg doses, uterine volume decreased by 42% (placebo 11%). After 4 weeks treatment, HMB and pain symptoms had substantially improved compared to the placebo group. However, due to the small study size and short length of follow-up it is not possible to recommend cetrorelix acetate as a treatment for HMB (Engel et al., 2006). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Hysterectomy</em></strong> <br />Hysterectomy is a very effective treatment for HMB but, in general, it is an option used when other treatments have failed or been rejected. It is associated with complications although for some areas, e.g. sexual functioning, evidence suggests that this may improve rather than deteriorate as has been supposed in the past (Halmesmaki et al., 2007). There is clearly no possibility of a woman becoming pregnant after the procedure. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />The studies referred to in the text above confirm the role of hysterectomy as the definitive treatment of HMB and highlight the risks associated with this form of surgery (Dickersin et al., 2007; El Nashar et al., 2007; Hehenkamp et al., 2007). <br /></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />HMB is a common problem impacting on physical, psychological and social well-being. However, it is reasonably simple to investigate and there are a number of effective treatments available. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><br /><strong>2009 AEU References<br /></strong>Cunningham E, Barreda L, Ngo M, Terasaki K, Munro MG.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Conservative management of stress urinary incontinence in women<p><strong>8. Conservative Management of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Women</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jane E P Newman<br />Clinical Specialist Physiotherapist in Women’s and Men’s Health, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Conservative management is recommended as a first line treatment for stress urinary incontinence and mixed urinary incontinence in women. International studies have shown an approximate 66% improvement rate with these patients provided they are given appropriate supervision. This has been evident across the age ranges. There is evidence that women do better in a regime of exercise supervised by specialist physiotherapists and specialist continence nurses in preference to unsupervised or leaflet provided care. The reasons for this may be that in addition to exercise, specialists are likely to cover numerous other areas which may also impact on the pelvic floor such as occupation, respiratory status, lifestyle issues, overall muscle fitness, diet and general health. There is also likely to be better compliance with exercise regimes in the long term if the woman fully understands how she can help herself and if she has had adequate time to address the problem with professional support.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other studies have suggested that supervised specialist physiotherapy by members of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Women’s Health (ACPWH) or ACPWH’s ‘sister’ organisations internationally, linked as part of a multidisciplinary team are more effective than community stand alone physiotherapy in reducing the workload and operating time of surgeons. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some studies have shown a link between low back pain in women and urinary incontinence and suggest the need to include core stability exercises for the low back when teaching a pelvic floor regime.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Criteria for inclusion in a conservative management regime:<br /><br />• Compliant well motivated women<br />• Suggestion of a weak pelvic floor on vaginal assessment with evidence that there is adequate muscle tissue to develop<br />• Suggestion on history taking of lifestyle issues which may be impacting on the pelvic floor <br />• Symptomatic young women who are of child bearing age who may get pregnant in the future<br />• Women where surgery is inappropriate for medical reasons<br />• Women with multiple problems in the pelvis where the pelvic floor may be having an impact on function e.g. pelvic pain and Dyspareunia</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assessment should include:<br /><br />• Detailed history of the ongoing nature of the urinary problem, previous treatment, frequency, urgency and function<br />• Detailed assessment of bowel habits and function to establish possible links between the anterior and posterior compartments of the pelvic floor and the possible need to liaise with the colo-rectal team<br />• Detailed assessment of the woman’s respiratory status and the need to liaise with the woman’s GP if care is required as for example in the case of a chronic cough aggravating symptoms in the pelvic floor<br />• Detailed vaginal and pelvic assessment to establish the impact of the pelvic muscles in the mid line, the strength and endurance of these muscles, the impact and strength of the deep abdominal muscles (Transversus Abdominus)<br />• Assessment of the woman’s lifestyle, working patterns and dietary patterns to establish whether any of these are impacting adversely on the pelvic floor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Treatment may include:<br /><br />• An explanation of the function and anatomy of the pelvic floor<br />• An intensive regime of supervised pelvic floor exercise<br />• An ‘outcome diary’ linking pain, function, diet and leakage with lifestyle and activities to try to educate the woman in how best to help herself<br />• Liaison with the others in the multi disciplinary team whether in the community or hospital setting to ensure contributing factors are addressed adequately. This may include discussion regarding medical management of mixed incontinence in relation to medication as there is evidence that these patients do best on a combined approach of conservative and drug regimes<br />• A supporting ‘hand out’ as an exercise and lifestyle reminder<br />• Various biofeedback regimes – these may include electrical stimulation<br />• Supporting exercise regimes for the core trunk stability muscle groups where these are also affected<br />• Advice on avoiding increasing symptoms, by poor bowel function e.g. constipation or straining, lifting or moving excessive weights and chronic respiratory conditions<br />• Education of the woman in bladder regulating patterns to try to re-establish a normal bladder pattern<br />• An explanation of why conservative management is not effective and why an exercise regime has failed to cure the urinary problem</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow on care:<br /><br />• Evidence suggests that women need to be encouraged to continue with a long term program of pelvic floor exercises for the benefits to be maintained<br />• There needs to be close liaison between those providing conservative management and providers of more interventionist treatments such as surgery and medical management, to provide a seamless progression if the conservative treatments do not work.<br /></p>\n<p>Additional note on mixed urinary incontinence:<br />• Many of the patients with mixed stress and urge incontinence will also benefit through the above conservative management. Numbers vary in different studies but good practice suggests that a multi-disciplinary approach of combined medication and conservative care may be beneficial.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Useful links:<br /></strong><a href=\"http://www.acpwh.org.uk/\">www.acpwh.org.uk</a> (Membership is by examination as a post graduate branch of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy)<br /><a href=\"http://www.csp.org.uk/\">www.csp.org.uk</a> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References<br /><br /></strong></p>\n<p>1.

Drug therapy in the management of overactive bladder syndrome</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspecialty trainee in urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson , Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a condition defined as urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence and usually with frequency and nocturia [1]. Pharmacological suppression of detrusor overactivity with anticholinergics (antimuscarinics) is the most widely used treatment for this condition. Anticholinergic drugs block the muscarinic receptors that mediate detrusor smooth-muscle contruction and have a direct, relaxing effect on the detrusor muscle.  There are a number of drug treatments available. They differ in their selectivity for various muscarinic receptors and some drugs have additional actions, such as direct smooth muscle effects. There is no evidence of any clinically important difference in efficacy between these antimuscarinic drugs. Based on a cost minimisation analysis, non-proprietary immediate-release oxybutynin is the most cost effective antimuscarinic drug [2]. Adverse effects are common with all antimuscarinic drugs and, therefore, early review of treatment is good practice. Oestrogen replacement has been promoted as a solution to urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women. Oestrogens help to maintain the health of tissues that are essential for normal pressure transmission in the urethra.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NICE guideline recommendations 2006</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><br /><em>Recommendations for anticholinergic drugs</em><br />Immediate release non-proprietary oxybutynin should be offered to women with OAB or mixed urinary incontinence (UI) as first-line antimuscarinic drug treatment, if bladder training has been ineffective. If immediate-release oxybutynin is not well tolerated, darifenacin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium or an extended release or transdermal formulation of oxybutynin should be considered as alternatives. Women should be counselled about the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs.<br />An early treatment review should be undertaken following any change in antimuscarinic drug therapy. Propiverine should be considered as an option to treat frequency of urination in women with OAB, but is not recommended for the treatment of UI. Flavoxate, propantheline and imipramine should not be used for the treatment of UI or OAB in women.</p>\n<p><em>Recommendations for oestrogens</em><br />Systemic hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for the treatment of UI. Intravaginal oestrogens are recommended for the treatment of OAB symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence for anticholinergic preparations</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Pharmacological suppression of detrusor overactivity with anticholinergics is the mainstay of OAB pharmacotherapy. There have been number of placebo-controlled randomised studies of antimuscarinic drugs and comparison RCTs of these drugs in recent years, as well as systematic reviews of available preparations [3,4,5].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Oxybutynin, propiverine, tolterodine and trospium chloride</em> have been used for many years to treat OAB symptoms. Sustained release oxybutynin transdermal patches, which release 3.9mg every 24 hours, have recently been launched in the UK [5,6,7]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Solifenacin and darifenacin</em> are newer bladder-selective anticholinergic preparations. They are more recent useful additions to the list of available drugs and may possibly have a lower incidence of adverse effects. Solifenacin is a long-acting  muscarinic antagonist. At 5mg and 10mg daily dosing it reduces the frequency of daily voids and number of urge and incontinence episodes. Efficacy has been observed as early as within one week of starting treatment. Darifenacin is a highly selective M3 receptor antagonist  available in 7.5 or 15 mg once-daily sustained-release form [8,9]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Fesoterodine</em> is the latest addition to the available list of drugs. It is a nonselective oral antimuscarinic agent that exerts its pharmacologic effects as a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Fesoterodine acts as a prodrug; when administered, it is rapidly hydrolysed by nonspecific esterases to the active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT). After oral dosing, the parent compound is not detectable in plasma. The main active metabolite of fesoterodine, 5-HMT, is identical to the active metabolite of tolterodine; 5-HMT is formed from tolterodine by cytochrome P450 2D6–mediated oxidation in the liver.  Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine 4 and 8 mg resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in bothersome OAB symptoms compared with placebo. Treatment effects appeared to be more pronounced with fesoterodine 8 mg than with tolterodine ER 4 mg or fesoterodine 4 mg, especially regarding urge incontinence episodes and volume voided per micturition. Fesoterodine 4 and 8 mg were generally well tolerated and discontinuations because of an adverse effect (AE) were low.  Observed AEs were low and similar to those of a placebo, except for dry mouth, which occurred at a higher rate with fesoterodine 8 mg. The availability of two doses of fesoterodine presents an additional clinical benefit, in that dose flexibility allows OAB treatment to be tailored to individual subject needs [10,11].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Many new promising compounds are emerging, which target key molecular pathways involved in micturition control but effective nonantimuscarinic treatments for OAB are currently scarce [12]. The most promising potential therapeutic targets include: nervous GABAergic, glycinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems; b-drenoceptors and cAMP metabolism; nonadrenergic–noncholinergic mechanisms such as purinergic and neuropeptidergic systems; vanilloid receptors; bladder afferent nerves; nonneuronal bladder signaling systems including urothelium and interstitial cells; prostanoids; Rho-kinase; and different subtypes of potassium and calcium different subtypes of potassium and calcium channels. Despite the enormous amount of new biologic insight, very few drugs with mechanism of action other than antimuscarinics have passed as yet the proof-of-concept stage. Further preclinical and clinical studies are urgently needed in this rapidly moving field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence for oestrogens</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Very little further evidence has become available since publication of the NICE guideline, Urinary incontinence in women (2006). Short-term studies of intravaginal oestrogens suggest some improvement in symptoms of incontinence and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. <br />Systemic oestrogen treatment does not confer any benefit in women with UI and there is evidence that it may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence in postmenopausal women. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Antimuscarinics remain the mainstay of medical therapy for overactive bladder. Intravaginal oestrogens provide some improvement in symptoms of incontinence and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. Despite the enormous amount of new biologic insight, very few drugs with mechanism of action other than antimuscarinics have passed as yet the proof-of-concept stage.

Intravesical injection of botulinum toxin is increasingly used as a treatment for refractory overactive bladder, with case reports and series in the literature suggesting beneficial effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NICE guideline 2006 recommendations on the use of botulinum toxin</strong></p>\n<p>Bladder wall injection with botulinum toxin A should be used in the treatment of idiopathic detrusor overactivity only in women who have not responded to conservative treatments and who are willing and able to self-catheterise. Women should be informed about the lack of<br />long-term data. <br />Botulinum toxin B is not recommended for the treatment of women with idiopathic OAB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence</strong></p>\n<p>Data on the use of botulinum toxin A in the management of idiopathic detrusor overactivity is still limited. The available data show cure or improvement of up to 90%, with duration of benefit between 3 and 12 months. Botulinum toxin B appears to be effective only in the short term (up to 6 weeks).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A)</strong></p>\n<p>Since the publication of the NICE guideline, several randomised controlled trials [7,8,11] evaluated BTX-A for the treatment of OAB refractory to conservative treatment. Patient numbers in these studies were small and included men and women. Duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months. The doses injected varied, ranging from 100 to 300 units (BOTOX) and 500 to 1000iu (DYSPORT) into 10–40 sites in the bladder wall. Intravesical BTX-A does appear to reduce incontinence when compared with placebo, with results reported:<br />• cure or improvement rates of 60–93% at 3 weeks to 12 months follow-up [3,7,8,11]<br />• duration of response to a single dose of a mean of 24 weeks (range 10–52 weeks).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intravesical BTX-A injections ameliorates all OAB symptoms within the first week after treatment, but urgency is most rapidly and consistently affected, suggesting an early effect on bladder afferent pathways [12]. The most common complication reported were voiding dysfunction and urinary retention (up to 43%), which usually resolved by 9 months [5,9,11]. Other complications reported were haematuria, pelvic pain, transient dysuria and UTI.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use of low doses of BTX-A (100U BOTOX) appeared to have a similar rate of improvement and were associated with significantly fewer adverse events (eg. urinary retention) compared with 150 or 200 U. However, the duration of therapeutic effectiveness was significantly shorter for the patients treated with 100 U compared with that for those treated with 150 or 200 U of BTX-A. [5]</p>\n<p><br />One study looked at the additional injection of low doses of BTX-A into the external sphincter muscle and concluded that for patients who are at high risk of post-treatment urinary retention this could be one option in reducing the risk [3].</p>\n<p><br />Injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle and suburothelial injections achieve a similar therapeutic effect on idiopathic detrusor overactivity. One RCT compared injections of 100 U BTX-A into detrusor muscle with suburothelial injections. A successful result at 3 months was achieved in 93% in the detrusor group and 80% in the suburothelial injection group. [8]</p>\n<p><br />Increasing evidence suggests that sensory nerve dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of OAB and, for this reason, targeting the afferent innervation of the bladder trigone during injection may provide clinical benefit. One study compared trigone or trigone-sparing injection of BTX-A. No significant difference in symptom score or treatment response was noted between the trigone and trigone-sparing groups. Further studies are needed to evaluate possible benefit of trigonal injection. [4]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Botulinum toxin B (BTX-B)</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Efficacy of BTX-B in the treatment of refractory idiopathic DO in men and women was evaluated in one placebo-controlled RCT [2]. BTX-B was found to have a limited duration of action, with most of its symptomatically beneficial effects wearing off by 10 weeks in most patients. Transient adverse effects were urinary retention, constipation and dry mouth [2,6]. <br />The short duration of action for BTX-B suggests it is unlikely to gain widespread use in the treatment of OAB. Its use will presumably be limitted to patients who have experienced tachyphylaxis with botulinum toxin A.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Intravesical botulinum toxin shows promise as a therapy for overactive bladder symptoms, but as yet too little controlled trial data exist on benefits and safety. Furthermore, the optimal dose of botulinum toxin for efficacy and safety has not yet been established. It must be recognised that the therapeutic use of intravesical BTX is relatively recent and the longterm effects are unknown at this stage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

Methodology</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The NICE guideline Urinary incontinence: the management of urinary incontinence in women published in 2006 was identified. The aim of this AEU is to update the evidence from 2006-2008.</p>\n<p>The original NICE search strategies were obtained and we devised our own search strategies using both these strategies and the involvement of the clinicians in our expert panel. Databases searched included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID Medline, OVID Embase and EBSCOHOST CINAHL.  Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the SIGN Embase Systematic Review filter, the SIGN Embase RCT filter, the Medline Systematic Review CRD filter, the Medline SIGN RCT filter and the CINAHL SIGN Systematic Review and SIGN RCT filters.  The search terms used included urinary incontinence; stress incontinence; overactive bladder; urge incontinence; Botulinum; sacral nerve stimulation; conservative management; quality of life. These were combined with sub-headings including: drug therapy; surgery. Limits such as ‘English in language’, adult and female were applied and the search was also restricted to the date range 2006 to 2008.</p>\n<p><br />The retrieved references were sifted by members of the expert panel to identify all the good quality papers. These papers were then manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document.  Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition.  When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained. Summaries were then written based on the NICE guideline to which has been added any new evidence where this has become available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/page.aspx?pagename=09UIAEUCON\">Link back to AEU Contents page.</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Pharmacotherapy for stress urinary incontinence<p><strong>6. Pharmacotherapy for stress urinary incontinence</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspecialty trainee in urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson , Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Background<br /></strong></p>\n<p>Stress urinary incontinence (stress UI) is a common, distressing condition known adversely to affect quality of life. Until recently the only available treatments were conservative measures, lifestyle modification and a variety of surgical procedures. </p>\n<p><br />Duloxetine is the first drug to be licensed for the treatment of stress UI. It is a potent balanced serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. The inhibition of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake during bladder storage is thought to increase pudendal nerve output, resulting in increased tone of the rhabdosphincter and subsequently improved urethral closure. Duloxetine has been evaluated in phase II and phase III clinical trials and was found to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of women with moderate to severe stress UI symptoms. </p>\n<p><br />Oestrogen replacement has been promoted as a solution to UI in postmenopausal women, although its chief mode of action is unclear. Oestrogens help to maintain the health of tissues that are essential for normal pressure transmission in the urethra. These include the sphincter muscles, urothelium and vascular tissues, as well as the urethral secretions that may help to create a ‘seal’. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NICE guideline recommendations 2006<br /></strong><br /><em>Recommendations for duloxetine</em></p>\n<p>Duloxetine is not recommended as a first-line treatment for women with predominant stress UI.</p>\n<p><br />Duloxetine should not routinely be used as a second-line treatment for women with stress UI, although it may be offered as second-line therapy if women prefer pharmacological to surgical treatment or are not suitable for surgical treatment. If duloxetine is prescribed, women should be counselled about its adverse effects.<br /> <br /><em>Recommendations for oestrogens</em></p>\n<p>Systemic hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for the treatment of UI. </p>\n<p><br />Intravaginal oestrogens are recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence</strong></p>\n<p><em>Evidence for duloxetine</em></p>\n<p>There have been further studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of duloxetine but there is still a lack of long-term safety data. Recent evidence from randomized placebo controlled trials have shown it to be significantly more effective than placebo in reducing incontinence episode frequency and improving quality of life scores [1-4]. </p>\n<p><br />However, adverse effects, particularly nausea, and discontinuation rates are very common.  Sixty-eight percent of patients discontinued duloxetine within the first 4 weeks of commencing treatment because of the adverse effects [5]. In one cohort study only 9% of patients were still taking duloxetine one year later [6]. The main reasons for discontinuation were intolerance of duloxetine’s side effects and perceived lack of efficacy. </p>\n<p><br />The data also suggest that the 20 mg BID dose escalation regimen may contribute to a decrease in the adverse event related discontinuation rate for women taking duloxetine. The results of one trial demonstrate that starting duloxetine treatment at a dose of 20 mg BID for 2 weeks before increasing the dose to the optimally effective 40 mg BID dose significantly reduced the risk of nausea and dizziness [7]. </p>\n<p><br />In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that duloxetine treatment can improve the quality of life of patients with stress urinary incontinence but it is unclear whether or not the benefits are sustainable. The commonest adverse effect was nausea and many women stopped the treatment as a consequence. Treatment with duloxetine can be considered in women not suitable for surgical treatment or awaiting surgery. If duloxetine is prescribed, women should be counselled about its adverse effects.</p>\n<p><br /><em>Evidence  for oestrogens</em></p>\n<p>Very little further evidence has become available since publication of the NICE guideline, Urinary incontinence in women (2006). Short-term studies of intravaginal oestrogens suggest some improvement in symptoms of incontinence and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of intravaginal oestrogens for the treatment of stress UI. </p>\n<p><br />Systemic oestrogen treatment does not confer any benefit in women with UI and there is evidence that it may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence in postmenopausal women. Systemic oestrogens are also associated with increased risk of thromboembolism.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1. Bump RC.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Sacral nerve stimulation in the management of overactive bladder syndrome<p><strong>4. Sacral nerve stimulation in the management of overactive bladder syndrome</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspecialty trainee in Urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson , Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a common condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life. Currently accepted practice is to offer lifestyle or behavioural modifications or antimuscarinic medications as initial treatments. </p>\n<p><br />Where these are unsuccessful, a range of surgical interventions may be considered. These aim to increase the capacity of the bladder, alter or modulate its nerve supply and contractility, or to bypass the lower urinary tract completely. </p>\n<p><br />Sacral nerve modulation (SNS) is a least invasive surgical procedure used in management of overactive bladder syndrome. The principle of neuromodulation is that appropriate electrical stimulation of the sacral reflex pathway will inhibit the reflex behaviour of the bladder.</p>\n<p> <br />Permanently implantable sacral root stimulators have been developed to provide chronic stimulation directly to the S3 nerve roots. Patients first undergo a percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) in which a needle is inserted through the sacral foramina under local anaesthetic. This is connected to an external stimulation source and left in place for a few days. Those who show satisfactory response to the PNE may then proceed to a permanent implant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>NICE guideline 2006 recommendations on use of sacral nerve stimulation<br /></strong><br />Sacral nerve stimulation is recommended for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity in women who have not responded to conservative treatments. Women should be offered sacral nerve stimulation on the basis of their response to preliminary percutaneous nerve evaluation. Life-long follow-up is recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Two systematic reviews and several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published recently showed that complete continence (completely dry with no incontinent episodes) or improvement of more than 50% in incontinence symptoms was observed in 50% and 80% of patients, respectively, following the procedure. This compared with 5% of patients in the control groups, who were receiving conservative treatments while waiting for an implant. All studies considered SNS in the S3 foramen via an implanted device. Most studies included men and women [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. </p>\n<p><br />In the one RCT that reported on patients with urgency-frequency, an improvement of more than 50% in incontinence symptoms was observed in 56% of patients, compared with 4% in the control group [4]. More evidence is available for patients with urge incontinence than for those with urgency-frequency.</p>\n<p><br />The results of the case series studies included in the systematic review showed similar results, with complete continence and improvement in symptoms being reported in 39% (139/361) and 67% (338/501) of patients with urge incontinence, respectively, and 41% (22/54) and 65% (75/116) of patients with urgency-frequency, respectively. The benefits of sacral nerve stimulation were reported to persist for at least 3-5 years after implantation.</p>\n<p><br />In the RCT of patients with urgency-frequency, after 6 months’ treatment, frequency was significantly reduced, and mean voided volume and bladder volume at first sensation to void were significantly increased in the SNS group compared with control, with improvements in several SF-36 domains in the active treatment group (n = 51; 90% women). At 2 years follow-up of 21 patients, 43% had a reduction in frequency of at least 50% and 62% had an increase in voided volume of least 50% [3].</p>\n<p><br />A satisfaction rate of 68% was reported at mean follow-up of 2 years in one study. Three studies found significant improvement in quality of life (QOL) at 18 months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Complications<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>Most complications observed in the studies were the result of technical problems related to implantation of the device. The results of the systematic review showed that, overall, the re-operation rate for patients with implants was 33% (283/860). The most common reasons for surgical revision were to replace or reposition implants due to pain or infection at the implant site, or to adjust and modify the lead system to correct breakage or migration. </p>\n<p><br />Pain at the site of the pulse generator or at the site of stimulation was reported in 24% (162/663) of patients, sometimes requiring replacement and repositioning of the pulse generator. Other complications included lead-related problems such as migration (16%), wound problems (7%), adverse effects on bowel function (6%), and infection (5%). Surgical intervention for these complications was reported in between 7% and 66% (median 22%) of patients. Removal of the implant was required in 4-11% (median 7%). Other adverse effects were cases of seroma formation, disturbed bowel function (1-7%), wound dehiscence or infection (3-15%), infection (2-9%), toe flexion (8%) and pain (abdominal, leg, pelvis and gluteal incision) (2-20%). No cases of long-lasting neurological complications were identified.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> <br /><br />Recent evidence continues to support SNS therapy as a safe and effective long-term treatment for OAB in appropriately selected cases refractory to other forms of treatment. Up to two-thirds of patients achieve continence or substantial improvement in symptoms after SNS, and the available data show that beneficial effects appear to persist for up to 3-5 years after implantation. Around one-third of patients may require re-operation, most often owing to pain at the implant site, infection, or the need for adjustment and modification of the lead system. Permanent removal of the electrodes may be required in one in ten patients. The treatment options for women who have not responded to conservative treatments are all costly and associated with significant morbidity. There is a stronger body of evidence to support the use of sacral nerve stimulation than augmentation cystoplasty, urinary diversion or botulinum toxin A.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1. Brazzelli M, Murray A, Fraser C.

    "description": "111-12009 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence<p><strong>7. Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspecialty trainee in urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson , Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Background<br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>The large number of different procedures described for the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (stress UI) reflects the numerous theories proposed to explain the pathophysiology of the condition and the continuing search for a procedure that can successfully deal with all cases. Although the range of procedures described is bewildering, a recent surgical classification simplifies them into those that aim to augment urethral closure and those that aim to support the bladder neck or urethra.<br /></p>\n<p>In 1997-98 approximately 8000 operations for stress UI were carried out in England over a 12-month period. By 2004-05 the annual number had increased by 16%, despite an approximately 90% reduction in the numbers of colposuspension and needle suspension procedures and a 30-50% reduction in bladder neck buttress, sling and periurethral injection procedures. This increase was entirely due to the rapid introduction of tension-free vaginal tape and similar mid-urethral tape procedures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NICE (2006) recommendations on surgical management of stress UI<br /></strong><br />Retropubic mid-urethral tape procedures using a ‘bottom-up’ approach with macroporous (type 1) polypropylene meshes are recommended as treatment options for stress UI if conservative management has failed. Synthetic slings using a retropubic ‘top-down’ or a transobturator foramen approach are recommended as alternative treatment options, provided women are made aware of the lack of long-term outcome data. <br />Intramural bulking agents should be considered for the management of stress UI if conservative management has failed. Women should be made aware that repeat injections may be required to achieve efficacy, efficacy diminishes with time and efficacy is inferior to that of a retropubic suspension or sling.<br /> <br />Open colposuspension and autologous rectus fascial sling are the recommended alternatives when clinically appropriate. Laparoscopic colposuspension is not recommended as a routine procedure for the treatment of stress UI in women. The procedure should be performed only by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon working in a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the assessment and treatment of UI.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence</strong></p>\n<p><em>Laparoscopic colposuspension</em></p>\n<p>Currently available evidence suggests that laparoscopic colposuspension may be as good as open colposuspension at two years postsurgery. There have been ten trials in which laparoscopic was compared with open colposuspension.  All the trials concluded that the advantages of laparoscopy included decreases in blood loss, postoperative pain, hospital stay and duration of catheterisation. However, laparoscopy did increase operative times by a mean of 13.7 minutes. There were no statistically significant differences in objective cure, de-novo detrusor overactivity and voiding dysfunction between laparoscopy and laparotomy. Subjective cure rates ranged from 58-96% in the laparotomy group and 62-100% in the laparoscopy group [1,2]. Significantly higher subjective and objective one-year cure rates were found for women randomised to two paravaginal sutures compared with one suture in a single trial [3].<br /> </p>\n<p>With the advent of polypropylene mid-urethral slings for stress UI, the purpose of laparoscopy for continence procedures has been questioned. In eight studies laparoscopic colposuspension has been compared with suburethral polypropele vaginal slings [4,5]. There were no significant differences in the reported subjective cure rates of the two procedures but objective cure rates at 18 months favoured slings. No significant differences were observed for postoperative voiding dysfunction and perioperative complications. Laparoscopic colposuspension had a significantly longer operation time and hospital stay. <br /></p>\n<p>In conclusion, short-term results favour mid-urethral slings over laparoscopic colposuspension. If laparoscopic colposuspension is performed, the use of two paravaginal sutures appears to be the most effective method.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Retrobubic versus transobturator tapes</em><br />Various types of suburethral tapes inserted via the transobturator route (tension-free vaginal tape obturator route (TVTO) and transobturator tape (TOT)) have been widely adopted for treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). There were five randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared TVTO with TVT and six RCTs that compared TOT with TVT. When compared by subjective cure, TVTO and TOT at 2-12 months were no better than TVT (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.60-1.21). Adverse events such as bladder injuries and voiding difficulties were less common, whereas groin/thigh pain, vaginal injuries or erosion of mesh were more common after tape insertion by the transobturator route. The evidence for short-term superiority of effectiveness of TOT is currently limited. Bladder injuries and voiding difficulties are lower but the risk of vaginal erosions and groin pain is higher with TVTO/TOT. Methodologically sound and sufficiently powered RCTs with long-term follow-up are needed and the results of continuing trials are awaited.</p>\n<p><br /><em>Single-incision sub-urethral short tape  (TVT-secur)<br /></em></p>\n<p>The first single-incision mini sling has been introduced recently (TVT Secur (Ethicon)). Few data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of this new type of sling. Its short-term success rate appears comparable with that of traditional midurethral slings [7-9]. However, long-term follow-up is warranted and comparative studies are needed to determine its true safety and efficacy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Use of adult muscle derived stem cells<br /></em></p>\n<p>Preclinical studies have suggested that transurethral injections of autologous myoblasts can assist in regeneration of the rhabdosphincter, and fibroblasts in reconstruction of the urethral submucosa.<br /></p>\n<p>In one clinical study the efficacy and safety of the application of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts for treating female stress UI were assessed. One hundred and twenty three women with stress UI (aged 36-84 years) were treated with transurethral ultrasonography-guided injections of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies. One year after implanting the cells, 79% of the women were completely continent, 13% had a substantial improvement in continence and 8% a slight improvement. The thickness of urethra and rhabdosphincter, as well as the contractility of the rhabdosphincter, were improved postoperatively [10]. <br /></p>\n<p>The same authors conducted a RCT comparing transurethral ultrasonography-guided injections of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies with standard transurethral endoscopic injections of collagen and found treatment with autologous stem cell effective and safe [11].<br /></p>\n<p>This novel treatment appears promising but more substantial data are required before it can be implemented into clinical practice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong> <br /><br />1. Dean NM, Ellis G, Wilson PD, Herbison GP.

Urinary incontinence and quality of life scores</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Mrs Alison Bardsley MSc, RGN, DN and Mrs Jo Turner BSc,RGN.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Urinary incontinence</strong></p>\n<p>Symptoms of urinary incontinence are common particularly in the older population. The estimated prevalence of urinary incontinence varies considerably between studies, mainly due to methodological issues and under-reporting due to embarrassment. Urinary symptoms can include frequency and urgency with or without incontinence, stress incontinence, urinary retention (complete and partial) and reflex incontinence. Urinary incontinence can have a severe impact on employment, social interactions and emotional well-being (1). High levels of depression and low quality of life have been reported in men and women with overactive bladder symptoms (2). The treatments currently available for incontinence are aimed at reducing the number of incontinent episodes and limit the impact on everyday life.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From a review of the evidence in the literature over the last 5 years the use of patient completed methods (including voiding diaries and questionnaires) for measuring the impact of incontinence on quality of life are becoming increasingly common both clinically and within research (3-12) . <br />The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) uses a grading system for recommendation of symptom scoring and quality of life scales based on validity, reliability and responsive to support their use and recommends the following validated tools for use in clinical practice and research:<br />  <br />ICIQ, BFLUTS, I-QOL, SUIQQ, UISS, SEAPI-QMM, ISS, ICS male (ISCmale SF) and KHQ.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Quality of life</strong></p>\n<p>The term quality of life is widely used in research. The World Health Organisation offers a definition which is includes physical, emotional and social well-being, not just the absence of disease (13) “Health related quality if life” (HRQL) refers to attributes valued by patients to have a sense of well-being: the extent to which they were able to maintain physical, emotional and intellectual function and ability to participate in valued activities within a community such as family and work. This highlights the multidimensional nature of quality of life and the individual’s perception in the context of their circumstances (14). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Measurement of quality of life and symptom scores</strong></p>\n<p>The symptoms of incontinence and their impact on an individual’s quality of life can be assessed in a number of ways. However the only valid way to measure the patient’s personal perspective is by using self completion questionnaires (15). Quality of life and symptom scoring tools are useful in clinical settings to standardise the measurement of severity of incontinence which can help to determine required care and to evaluate the effectiveness of care provided. </p>\n<p><br />Patient completed questionnaires are used to record the presence and severity of urinary symptoms including incontinence as well as the impact on quality of life and everyday activities. Although questionnaires used in clinical research can be long and detailed, those used for clinical practice need to be short and easy to complete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>  <br /><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The experience for people of the symptoms of incontinence, its impact on their quality of life and the outcomes of healthcare desired by patients is uniquely individual and multifaceted. Measuring quality of life and symptoms in a way that reflects the patient’s voice presents a challenge to healthcare professionals. However, identifying patient outcomes is the most credible method of assessment and can be achieved in a number of ways. The scoring of symptoms and quality of life in urinary incontinence provides a method of quantifying the impact of urinary symptoms for patients and can be used as a measure to assess outcomes of treatment at various stages. Evaluation and outcome measures should be built into all clinical assessment and research projects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1. Irwin D, Milsom I, Reilly K, Hunskaar S, Coyne K S, Kopp Z, Herschom S, Kelleher C, Hampel C, Artibani W, Arams P.

Aetiology</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>No new evidence was identified by our updated literature search on this topic. The information below has been reproduced from our 2009 AEU.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Primary dysmenorrhoea</strong></p>\n<p>Primary dysmenorrhoea is said to occur in the absence of obvious underlying disease [Cameron, 1999; Rees, 2003]. Primary dysmenorrhoea usually dates from the onset of ovulatory cycles, which occur within 6–12 months of menarche [Rees, 2003]. Prostaglandins in menstrual fluid cause uterine hypercontractility: excessive contractions and high resting myometrial tone. Blood flow is reduced during contractions, which probably results in ischaemic pain. The roles of vasopressin and leukotrienes are unclear, but elevated levels are found in women with dysmenorrhoea [Lumsden and Norman, 1997; Rees, 2003; French, 2005]. <br />• Factors associated with primary dysmenorrhoea include the following [Sundell et al, 1990; Parazzini et al, 1994;Harlow and Park, 1996; Montero et al, 1996; Alonso and Coe, 2001; Wang et al, 2004]: <br />o Early menarche (12 years or younger) o Menstrual cycles greater than 35 days long <br />o Menstruation for 7 days or longer <br />o Increased body weight and obesity <br />o Smoking<br /> o Stress, anxiety, depression, and disruption of social support networks <br />o Attempts to lose weight (associated with increased menstrual pain, independent of body mass index) <br />o Alcohol may reduce the risk of dysmenorrhoea, although the pain is likely to be more severe.<br />Tubal ligation does not appear to be associated with dysmenorrhoea. A cross-sectional analysis of 976 women, aged 36–44, found no difference in dysmenorrhoea in women with or without a history of tubal ligation [Harlow et al, 2002]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Secondary dysmenorrhoea</strong></p>\n<p>Secondary dysmenorrhoea implies there is underlying pelvic pathology. There is typically a later age of onset than primary dysmenorrhoea; usually 30-45 years old [Cameron, 1999]. <br />• Causes include the following [Dawood, 1990; Rees, 2003; Nasir and Bope, 2004]:<br /> o Adenomyosis <br />o Cervical stenosis (e.g. after uterine or cervical surgery) <br />o Congenital malformations <br />o Endometrial polyps <br />o Endometriosis <br />o Fibroids <br />o Imperforate hymen <br />o Intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) <br />o Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) <br />o Ovarian tumours <br />How the underlying pathology causes pain is not always clear. Abnormal prostaglandin production may be involved in women with an IUCD, and those with PID, adenomyosis or endometriosis [Lumsden and Norman, 1997].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p>Alonso, C. and Coe, C.L.

Diagnosis is usually by history with negative pelvic evaluation findings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Prevalence</strong> </p>\n<p><br />The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea in adolescent girls ranges from 43–93%; it is 4–23% for severe dysmenorrhoea in the same population [Klein and Litt, 1981; Svanberg and Ulmsten, 1981; Andersch and Milsom, 1982; Wilson and Keye, 1989; Robinson et al, 1992; Harlow and Park, 1996; Campbell and McGrath, 1997; Davis and Westhoff, 2001]. Discrepancies in prevalence rates are due to differences in the ages of the study populations and the definitions used. In one Australian study, only 18% adolescent girls consulted a doctor about dysmenorrhoea, although 53% of those affected said it limited their activities [Hillen et al, 1999].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Andersch, B. and Milsom, I.

The following findings suggest secondary dysmenorrhoea is the diagnosis [Smith, 1993; Rees, 2003; DynaMed, 2005]: <br />• Adnexal mass <br />• Asymmetric enlargement of the uterus <br />• Mucopurulent cervical discharge <br />• Painful nodules in the pouch of Douglas <br />• Polyps protruding through the cervical os <br />• Restricted movement of the uterus <br />• Symmetric enlargement of the uterus <br />• Thickening of adnexal structures<br />• Uterine tenderness</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Investigations</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>If secondary dysmenorrhoea is suspected or there is poor response to treatment: <br />• Send vaginal swabs to exclude infection (in particular chlamydia and gonorrhoea) <br />• Organise an ultrasound of the abdomen/pelvis <br />• Further investigation is usually required.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p><br />The most important differential diagnosis is secondary dysmenorrhoea [Alzubaidi, 2004]. Consider other causes of lower abdominal pain which occur coincidentally, even in women with a history of cyclical menstrual pain: <br />• Acute appendicitis <br />• Ectopic pregnancy <br />• Urinary tract infection <br />• Inflammatory bowel disease <br />• Irritable bowel syndrome</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>CKS References</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Alzubaidi, N.

A trial period of six months is usually sufficient to see an improvement in the majority of patients.<br />Between 10% and 20% of women who present with apparent primary dysmenorrhoea are unresponsive to standard drug treatments. Some of these women may have secondary dysmenorrhoea and require appropriate investigations [Rees, 2003].</p>\n<p>Women with suspected secondary dysmenorrhoea should be referred to a gynaecologist in the following cases: <br />• Abnormal findings on examination <br />• Severe symptoms <br />• Additional gynaecological symptoms <br />• Failure to respond to analgesics and/or COCs <br />Finding an underlying cause usually requires specialist investigations, such as laparoscopy to exclude endometriosis. Treatment should be targeted at the underlying cause. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that the following women should be referred [NICE, 2005]: <br />• If there are clinical features suggestive of cervical cancer - urgently refer. <br />• If there is persistent inter-menstrual bleeding and pelvic examination is negative - consider urgent  referral. <br />• If there is a palpable abdominal or pelvic mass on examination that is not obviously uterine fibroids nor of gastrointestinal or urological origin: <br />o Refer urgently for an ultrasound, and if the scan is suggestive of cancer an urgent referral should be made. <br />o If urgent ultrasound is not available, urgently refer. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Follow-up advice</strong> </p>\n<p>Primary dysmenorrhoea: <br />• Ask the woman to return after 2–3 months if symptoms are not controlled.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Dysmenorrhoea - Management of dysmenorrhoea<h3>7. Management of dysmenorrhoea</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>General Management</strong></p>\n<p>Explain what the condition is and its benign nature. This may be all that is required, particularly in women with mild symptoms. Enquire into factors that have been associated with dysmenorrhoea:</p>\n<p>Smoking: advise women who smoke that dysmenorrhoea is more common and severe in smokers, but that it is not known whether stopping smoking improves symptoms [Sundell et al, 1990; Parazzini et al, 1994]. </p>\n<p>Weight: advise women that being overweight is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhoea [Harlow and Park, 1996]. However, it is unclear if weight loss improves symptoms: a cross-sectional survey of adolescent girls found that attempting to lose weight was associated with an increased incidence of menstrual pain [Montero et al, 1996]. See the CKS topic on Obesity. </p>\n<p>Alcohol: although alcohol is associated with a decreased prevalence, it may cause more severe pain if dysmenorrhoea does occur [Parazzini et al, 1994; Harlow and Park, 1996]. See the CKS topic on Alcohol - problem drinking.</p>\n<p>Stress: stress, anxiety, depression and lack of social support have all been associated with dysmenorrhoea [Alonso and Coe, 2001; Wang et al, 2004]. </p>\n<p>IUCDs can cause dysmenorrhoea and may require removal if adequate pain relief is not provided by analgesics [Smith, 1993]. However, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system reduces dysmenorrhoea and is an alternative if an IUCD is still desired [Luukkainen and Toivonen, 1995; Baldaszti et al, 2003].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Non-drug treatments</strong> </p>\n<p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): the available evidence suggests TENS is effective treatment and may represent a suitable alternative for women who prefer not to use medication, or wish to minimize their use of analgesics. A Cochrane review (search date to August 2001) found that high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was more effective than placebo at pain relief in primary dysmenorrhoea [Proctor et al, 2002]. Low-frequency TENS was no more effective than placebo. A recent small RCT also suggested that TENS is more effective than placebo TENS in improving symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (Wang et al, 2009).</p>\n<p>Acupuncture and acupressure: A Cochrane review (search date to August 2001) found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain in primary dysmenorrhoea [Proctor et al, 2002]. A recent systematic review of 32 trials also found there is no convincing evidence for the use of acupuncture in primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies are generally of low methodological quality and small sample size. There is, therefore, an urgent need for randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of acupuncture (Yang et. al., 2008). One RCT since has provided some evidence that acupuncture is effective in improving symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, with QALY analysis suggesting it is also cost-effective (Witt et al, 2009). Similarly, a recent RCT of acupressure against placebo acupressure showed that the method was significantly better in improving symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (Wang et al, 2009).</p>\n<p>Exercise: although it is often advocated, there is conflicting evidence over whether exercise improves dysmenorrhoea. A recent systematic review concluded that there was still insufficient evidence that exercise is likely to be effective in reducing primary dysmenorrhoea and that evidence from a large RCT is required (Daley 2008).<br />Dietary supplements: some women may prefer to try dietary supplements first before COCs or NSAIDs; however, they have not been shown to be of benefit [Proctor and Murphy, 2001].</p>\n<p>Alternative medicines: A large number of trials have been conducted to investigate a variety of alternative and complementary therapies in the management of dysmenorrhoea. One RCT showed Psidii guajavae folium extract appears to be useful in primary dysmenorrhoea (Doubova et. al., 2007). A more recent RCT showed the Iranian herb SCA  (saffron, celery seed and anise) at 500mg to be well tolerated and more effective than mefenamic acid 250mg or placebo in improving symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (Nahid 2009). Ginger (250mg) has been tested in a RCT against mefenamic acid (250mg) and ibuprofen (400mg) and was found to be equally effective (Ozgoli et al, 2009). The French maritime bark extract Pycnogenol was also shown to be more effective than placebo, and its effects were observed to last for at least one additional menstrual cycle after its administration was stopped (Suzuki et al, 2008). There appears to be some initial evidence that the Korean herbal medicine Chiljehyangbuhwan might improve symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, and is well-tolerated (Jang et al 2009). The Chinese herbal remedy Si-Wu-Tang may also be effective in improving dysmenorrhoea (Zhu et al, 2008).</p>\n<p>Behavioural therapy: Both physical and psychological coping strategies have been poorly studied, and currently there is insufficient evidence of benefit.  A Clinical Evidence review (search date to July 2004) found a RCT showing that only women with spasmodic dysmenorrhoea experienced significantly less pain with relaxation compared with group discussion or waiting list control [Proctor and Farquhar, 2005]. A more recent systematic review concluded that there is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective in dysmenorrhoea. However, the results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials (Proctor et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Drug Treatments</strong></p>\n<p>Analgesia: Paracetamol may provide adequate pain relief for women with mild symptoms. One placebo-controlled study also showed that caffeine may act as an analgesic adjuvant, enhancing the efficacy of paracetamol in dysmenorrhoea (Ali et. al., 2007). <br />Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and are thought to relieve dysmenorrhoea by decreasing uterine prostaglandin levels, resulting in reduced uterine contractility. In a three-way, crossover study, aceclofenac and naproxen provided better pain relief in primary dysmenorrhoea than placebo (Letzel et. al., 2006). A Cochrane review (search date to April 2003) found that NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea [Marjoribanks et al, 2003]. Aspirin was less effective than other NSAIDs, but otherwise no differences in efficacy between NSAIDs were detected. The same review found two trials comparing paracetamol with an NSAID in primary dysmenorrhoea [Marjoribanks et al, 2003]. No difference in pain relief was found, but the authors pointed out that the available evidence had little power to detect such differences.<br />The choice of NSAID remains unclear. <br />In a small crossover study, etoricoxib provided better pain relief, less menstrual blood loss and fewer side-effects than mefenamic acid in primary dysmenorrhoea but with an unclear dosage regime  (Nor Azlin et al., 2008). Lumiracoxib was evaluated for the first time for use in dysmenorrhoea in a large double-blind trial against placebo or naproxen. It relieved pain better than placebo and as well as naproxen, and was well-tolerated. (Daniels et al., 2008).  Naproxen itself was also tried against celecoxib and placebo, and was found to be more effective than both in reducing pain intensity. It was well-tolerated at 550mg but produced some mild nausea [Daniels et al, 2009]. A small RCT showed the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor dexketoprofen (25mg) to be as effective in alleviating symptoms of dysmenorrhoea as ketoprofen (50mg) and theoretically safer because it only contains the active enantiomer; neither had any adverse effects [Balani et al 2008]. Diclofenac was found to be effective in decreasing the intensity of dysmenorrhoea at 50mg and 100mg in two small double-blind RCTs against placebo, rofecoxib 25mg and meloxicam 7.5mg (COX-2 selective inhibitors) [Chantler et al 2008; Chantler et al 2009]. High and low dose dexibuprofen (200mg or 300 mg) were found to be more effective than ibuprofen 400mg in a good-quality, relatively large study when administered for 3-5 days per cycle, with the lower dose being better tolerated [Kollenz 2009].<br />A combination of sumatriptan and naproxen has been studied in women who suffer from menstrual migraine and dysmenorrhoea. A combination of sumatriptan 85mg and Naproxen sodium 500mg was found to be more effective than placebo in two large RCTs in alleviating non-pain symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea such as migraine. However, the levels of dysmenorrhoea were equivalent in the treatment and placebo groups (Mannix et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Hormonal treatments</strong></p>\n<p>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are particularly useful if contraception is also required. COCs are thought to relieve dysmenorrhoea by inducing endometrial thinning and inhibiting ovulation, resulting in low levels of uterine prostaglandins [Muse, 1990]. The WHO recommends that COCs can be used from menarche [FFPRHC, 2004]. <br />The most recent Cochrane review concluded that there is some evidence supporting the use of the COC as a treatment for dysmenorrhoea. There were no significant differences between different COC preparations, and since those with doses of oestrogen of less than 35 micrograms were effective, it is recommended that this should be the preparation of choice (Wong et al, 2009). <br /></p>\n<p>Other hormonal treatments that can be tried include: </p>\n<p>Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DepoProvera): This results in amenorrhoea in most women within the first year of use and therefore can be a useful treatment for dysmenorrhoea [French, 2005]. However, where contraception is required in younger women with dysmenorrhoea, the preferred choice is a COC. </p>\n<p>The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system: This is not licensed for dysmenorrhoea, but there is some evidence of benefit. It might be considered for a woman who needs long-term contraception, especially if menorrhagia is also a problem [Smith, 1993; Luukkainen and Toivonen, 1995]. <br />Combining different treatments may be a useful option. Although no trials have specifically looked at the benefits of combining different treatments for dysmenorrhoea, such as an NSAID with a COC, this is a reasonable option if symptoms are not adequately controlled with either treatment alone</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Further Treatments</strong></p>\n<p>Menstrual cycle suppressants, such as progestogens, danazol (unlicensed indication), and GnRH agonists (unlicensed indication), are occasionally used to treat severe primary dysmenorrhoea unresponsive to other treatments. Although there is trial evidence of effectiveness for the treatment of endometriosis-related menstrual pain, there are no RCTs in primary dysmenorrhoea. <br />Other drugs that might be considered include anticholinergic antispasmodics, glyceryl trinitrate, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-agonists, although the evidence to support their use is limited [French, 2005]. One RCT has shown that glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches relieved primary dysmenorrhoea; however, headaches reduced its efficacy and tolerability (Modares et. al., 2008).<br />One study showed that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), can relieve primary dysmenorrhoea. The authors suggest SERMs may constitute a therapeutic option in selected groups of patients such as BRCA carriers, breast cancer survivors or those who fail to respond to NSAIDs or COCs (Pierzynski et. al., 2006). <br />Surgery has been used in the past to treat dysmenorrhoea when medical treatments have failed; however, this is not standard practice in the UK.  The mechanism by which surgery is supposed to have an effect is by interrupting cervical sensory nerve fibres through uterine nerve ablation (UNA), which involves transecting the uterosacral ligaments at their insertion into the cervix, or presacral neurectomy (PSN), which involves the total removal of the presacral nerves lying within the boundaries of the interiliac triangle. <br />However, a Cochrane review (search date to 1998) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea regardless of cause [Proctor et al, 2005]. A systematic review of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways in dysmenorrhoea reached a similar conclusion (Latthe et. al., 2007).</p>\n<p>The following treatments have been proposed as treatments for dysmenorrhoea, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use.<br />• Guaifenesin is an expectorant that has been studied in dysmenorrhoea due to its proposed effects on cervical dilatation and cervical mucus thinning. It was found to be no more effective than placebo in one RCT [Marsden et al, 2004]. <br />• Leukotriene antagonists have been suggested as a treatment, because elevated leukotrienes levels are found in women with dysmenorrhoea [Lumsden and Norman, 1997; Rees, 2003; French, 2005]. However, Montelukast was no more effective than placebo in one small RCT [Harel et al, 2004]. <br />• Spinal manipulation has been proposed as a treatment. One hypothesis is that mechanical problems with certain vertebrae affect pelvic sympathetic nerves, resulting in vasoconstriction of uterine blood vessels and dysmenorrhoea. However, a Cochrane review (search date to March 2004) found that high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation was no more effective than sham manipulation, although it was possibly more effective than no treatment [Proctor et al, 2001a]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Balani, M.

Search Methodology</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 2006 CKS guideline on dysmenorrhoea was identified and used the basis for the first Annual Evidence Update. The original search carried out for the CKS guideline included publications published up to 2005. The first AEU therefore searched the literature from 2006-2008 to ensure that all relevant papers published since the CKS guideline were identified. We have now updated this search to cover papers published within the last year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Pubmed, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the Pubmed Systematic Review 2 or more terms minimum difference filter, Pubmed RCT CRD/Cochrane Highly Sensitive filter, Embase OVID Systematic Review SIGN Filter, Embase OVID RCT SIGN Filter, CINAHL Systematic Review SIGN Filter and the CINAHL RCT SIGN Filter. The search terms used included dysmenorrhoea; period pain; menstrual cramp; cyclic pain; monthly pain and these were combined with the limits ‘English in language’ and restricted to 2008 to 2009.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of relevant papers identified were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following summary document is based on the existing CKS guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited. Readers are referred to the CKS guideline for the citation details of the older studies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=343662&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=6082\">Link back to AEU Contents page</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Epidemiology and aetiology of endometriosis<h3>3. Epidemiology and aetiology of endometriosis</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is difficult to define the epidemiology of endometriosis precisely because a surgical procedure is required to make the diagnosis definitively. However, the following are best estimates:</p>\n<p><br />• Endometriosis affects 10-15% of all women in the reproductive years. <br />• The incidence is 40-60% in women with dysmenorrhoea and 20-30% in those with subfertility. <br />• Risk factors include a heavy menstrual load (due to short cycle length and long duration of flow). <br />• Current/recent use of the combined oral contraceptive (COC), smoking and exercise may be protective. <br />• The sisters and daughters of affected women are 6-9 times more likely to develop endometriosis than women in the general population.  A recent systematic review has analysed the potential genetic associations with endometriosis. However, no firm conclusions could be drawn. A large number of studies have considered putative genetic markers, and these may be of future benefit in assessing the risk of disease development, or in understanding disease pathogenesis (Montgomery et al., 2008).<br />• Endometriosis is a considerable burden in terms of both direct and indirect healthcare costs, and its affect on quality of life (Gao et. al., 2006).</p>\n<p><br />A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the aetiology of endometriosis. The most dominant theory is retrograde menstruation (the passage of viable endometrial cells along the fallopian tubes into the pelvis at the time of menstruation).</p>\n<p><br />• However, retrograde menstruation occurs commonly in all women. A systematic review found evidence supporting the retrograde menstruation theory. A significantly higher prevalence of endometriotic lesions was found in the right subphrenic area. The authors explain this by the fact that peritoneal fluid, which is transported clockwise, is trapped in the right hypochondrium by the falciform ligament (Vercellini et al., 2007). <br />• It is likely that aberrant function in related pathophysiological systems (e.g. immunity, cell clearance, angiogenesis) is responsible for the implantation and subsequent growth of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. <br />• The disease causes chronic inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cyst formation. <br />• Endometriosis has been associated in the past with various malignancies (e.g. ovarian cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). However, the data are inconclusive and the risks, if they exist, may not be clinically relevant (Somigliana et al., 2006). Another recent systematic review, however, looked at causality versus bias for interpreting data demonstrating an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. The authors concluded that a causal relationship exists but the frequency of malignant transformation of endometriotic lesions into ovarian cancer is similar to that of eutopic endometrium (Vigano et al., 2007). <br />• A systematic review of the effect of food intake on endometriosis and dysmenorrhoea revealed that there are no clear data supporting dietary recommendations. Some studies suggested that fish oil (n-3 oils) may reduce pain symptoms in endometriosis. The authors suggested further studies on this issue (Fjerbaek and Knudsen, 2007).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p><br />Montgomery G., Nyholt D., et al.

Introduction</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stephen Kennedy, Clinical Reader/Head of Department, Nuffield Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, University of Oxford, who is trustee of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is the fourth Endometriosis Annual Evidence Update.</p>\n<p><br />The purpose of the last Evidence Update in March 2009 was to summarise and update the information contained in the guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists in 2006 and the European Society for Human Reproduction &amp; Embryology (ESHRE) in 2005.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We have continued the same approach in the 2010 update.  We provide a summary of the ESHRE guideline (updated in 2008) to the investigation and management of endometriosis, alongside our own search of data from high quality studies published in the last year. References relating to new, clinically relevant studies are provided in the text.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We hope that, in time, this site will become the single portal for all health care professionals and women with endometriosis who require high quality information as an aid to clinical decision-making. We also hope that the information provided will improve standards of care throughout the UK.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lastly, it is important to mention that endometriosis was chosen as one of the first topics for the Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments (DUETS). This on-line resource gives priority to identifying and publishing unanswered questions about the effects of treatments which have been asked by patients and clinicians, whilst noting therapeutic uncertainties identified through systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and other formal mechanisms. Uncertainties that we have identified during our 2010 evidence update can be found listed in the DUETs page of this AEU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/WOMENSHEALTH/ViewResource.aspx?resID=343626&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=11472\">Link back to AEU Contents page</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Management of endometriosis-associated subfertility<h3>8. Management of endometriosis-associated subfertility</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A review article concluded that women with stage I-II endometriosis-associated infertility benefit from laparoscopic treatment. Two studies demonstrated an increased pregnancy rate amongst those who underwent surgical treatment compared with diagnostic laparoscopy alone (Yeung et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Whether endometriosis adversely affects pregnancy rates in assisted reproduction has always been controversial. Interestingly, therefore, a meta-analysis has shown that pregnancy rates following controlled ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination (IUI) are significantly lower in women with endometriosis compared to controls, but there are no significant differences in women treated with IVF/ICSI (Kunz et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />There has been continuing uncertainty about the best surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas to improve IVF outcomes (DUETs) and avoid damaging ovarian function (DUETs) in infertile women.</p>\n<p><br />A Cochrane review update concluded that excisional surgery for endometriomas provides a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation for spontaneous pregnancy (Hart et al, 2008), but there is still insufficient evidence to determine the best treatment before IVF. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies concluded that the available data show surgical management of endometriomas has no effect on IVF pregnancy rates and ovarian response to stimulation compared to no treatment (Tsoumpou et al, 2008). </p>\n<p><br />The optimum technique for cyst removal has also been considered. A review article determined that cyst excision compared with drainage had greater effects on pain and pregnancy outcomes. However, one study showed no difference in pregnancy rates following controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing cystectomy rather than drainage (reviewed in Yeung et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />There has also been uncertainty about the role of prolonged GnRH agonist treatment before IVF (DUETs). A small RCT has added little to the evidence base by showing that 2 months treatment before IVF produced a ‘trend’ towards an increase in the implantation rate in women with Stage III-IV disease (Ma et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />An RCT with five year follow-up concluded that adjuvant treatment with a GnRH agonist, following conservative surgery for Stage III-IV endometriosis had no effect on pregnancy rates (Loverro et al., 2008) and a small RCT suggested that combined laparoscopic surgery and pentoxifylline therapy for endometriosis-associated infertility might improve pregnancy rates at 6 months follow-up (Creus et al, 2008). However, a systematic review concluded that there is overall no evidence to support the use of pentoxifylline as a treatment for subfertility in women with endometriosis, with no evidence of increased clinical pregnancy rates in women treated with pentoxifylline compared with placebo (Lv, 2009).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potential benefit of second line surgery for women with recurrent endometriosis and a desire for pregnancy has been assessed. Conception rates following second line surgery varied from 12 to 47%. Studies comparing primary surgery with repeat surgery found a reduced pregnancy rate in women undergoing second line surgery. Overall, studies comparing only IVF or second line surgery prior to IVF found no difference in pregnancy rates between each procedure (Vercellini et al., 2009).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Lv D., Song H., Li Y., Clarke J. &amp; Shi G.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Non-surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain<h3>6. Non-surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis can be a chronic and debilitating disease, and few treatment options are entirely satisfactory. A cure may be achievable but for many women the medical and surgical treatments currently available have their limitations and symptoms often return after treatment.</p>\n<p><br />Some women prefer not to take hormonal medication and are able to control their symptoms with analgesics. Although non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may relieve endometriosis-associated pain, there is too little evidence to assess their effectiveness. NSAIDs have significant side-effects (e.g. gastric ulceration and an anti-ovulatory effect when taken at mid-cycle). Other analgesics may be effective but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations.  A Cochrane review found no significant difference between naproxen sodium and placebo in providing adequate pain relief for endometriosis. However, the authors highlight the paucity of evidence in this area, as only one trial was identified that could be included in this review (Allen, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />There is some evidence that high frequency TENS, acupuncture, vitamin B1 and magnesium may help to relieve dysmenorrhoea, but there is limited evidence on such treatments in managing endometriosis-associated pain. The role of Japanese acupuncture in managing such pain appears to be limited. A 2008 study saw women randomly allocated to acupuncture or sham treatment for an eight week treatment protocol. At four weeks, women in the acupuncture group had a significantly greater decrease in pain scores compared with the sham group. However, this difference was not sustained at eight weeks. Although both groups had a reduction in pain score from baseline, the difference between sham and treatment groups was not significant (Wayne et al., 2008).</p>\n<p><br />A Cochrane review considered the effectiveness and safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) in alleviating endometriosis-related pain. After laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis, combined oral and enema administration of CHM has a comparable benefit to gestrinone but with fewer observed side effects. Oral plus enema administration of CHM showed a greater reduction in average pain scores than danazol and in the size of adnexal masses with fewer adverse effects (Flower et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />A systematic review of clinical and experimental data on the use of medicinal herbs in the treatment of endometriosis illustrated the lack of evidence from clinical studies (Wieser et al., 2007). However, the review highlighted the anti-inflammatory and pain-alleviating mechanisms of action of many herbal remedies and predicted that they might have a beneficial effect in endometriosis symptoms, if tested in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p><br />The options for hormonal treatment include the COC, progestagens, androgenic drugs and GnRH agonists; at appropriate doses, all suppress ovarian activity and menstruation. The levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS) also reduces endometriosis-associated pain (ESHRE 2007).  </p>\n<p><br />The principal hormonal drugs studied – COCs, danazol, gestrinone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and GnRH agonists – are equally effective at relieving endometriosis-associated pain when prescribed for 6 months but their side-effect and cost profiles differ. When used to manage endometriosis-associated pain, intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 150mg can be given every three months. An RCT randomised one group of women to receive monthly injections for 6 months, followed by 3 monthly injections, whilst the second group had 3 monthly injections throughout the treatment period. This trial found no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction between two different dosing schedules at various follow-up periods (Cheewadhanaraks et al., 2009). </p>\n<p><br />Implanon® may also be an effective treatment for endometriosis related pain. Compared with depot MPA, it demonstrated an equivalent improvement in pain scores over a 12 month study period (Walch et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />An RCT in women with endometriosis found dienogest (DNG) to be comparable with buserelin acetate (BA) in reducing symptoms. DNG also resulted in less bone mineral density loss compared with BA (Harada et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Maintaining women symptom free after successful treatment with GnRH agonists has also been considered. Danazol and mid- or low-dose oral contraceptives were shown to maintain women symptom free effectively for 12 months of treatment and prevent the recurrence of disease (Kitawaki et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />The use of aromatase inhibitors and their effect on pain in endometriosis was considered in a systematic review. Seven studies (case reports and case series) all tended to show improvement in pain scores, lesion size and quality of life in women using aromatase inhibitors. One RCT also showed that aromastase inhibitors in conjunction with GnRH agonists improved pain scores, as compared to GnRH agonists alone (Patwardhan et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />Promising conclusions were found in a literature review regarding medical treatment for rectovaginal disease, which was shown to have a beneficial effect on pain relief and lesion size, as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life. Different forms of medical treatment appeared effective, including GnRH analogues, danazol, the LNG-IUS and aromatase inhibitors (Vercellini et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />It is also important to bear in mind that: <br />• medical treatment does not always provide complete pain relief and some patients fail to respond at all. <br />• symptom recurrence is common following medical treatment. <br />• some side-effects limit long-term use and may produce poor compliance, e.g. androgenic side-effects associated with danazol (Selak et al., 2007). GnRH agonist therapy may result in up to 6% BMD loss in the first 6 months and the loss may not always be entirely reversible. However, the concomitant use of ‘add-back’ (oestrogen and progestagen) therapy protects against BMD loss at the lumbar spine during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment. <br />• the COC and Depo-Provera can be used long term, but danazol and GnRH agonists are usually restricted to 6 months; however, one study suggests 3 months with a GnRH agonist may be as effective as 6 months in terms of pain relief. <br />• although the COC and GnRH agonist therapy appear to be equally effective, the published studies are all small and no other treatments have been assessed as comparators (Davis et al., 2007). Therefore, there is a clear need to evaluate fully the role of the COC in managing symptoms associated with endometriosis.</p>\n<p><br />A small double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial has shown benefit in using a low dose combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) in reducing endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhoea (Harada et al., 2008). The study is helpful because of the uncertainty that exists about the effectiveness of the COCP in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain (DUETS).</p>\n<p><br />Another small double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial found no benefit from using Infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, to treat pain associated with deeply infiltrating disease (Koninckx et al., 2008).</p>\n<p><br />It is unclear whether hormonal treatment causes atrophy of endometriotic lesions, especially as the natural history of the untreated disease is unknown. The available data suggest that MPA and luteal phase dydrogesterone are ineffective, whereas gestrinone may be effective. The effects of danazol and the GnRH agonist, triptorelin, are inconclusive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Allen C., Hopewell S., Prentice A. &amp; Gregory D. (2009) NSAIDs for Pain in Women with Endometriosis.

Search Methodology</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The aim of the literature search for the 2010 annual evidence update was to update the search carried out in 2009. Search strategies from the RCOG guideline and the ESHRE guideline were again replicated and the databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Pubmed, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the Pubmed Systematic Review 2 or more terms minimum difference filter, Pubmed RCT CRD/Cochrane Highly Sensitive filter, Embase OVID Systematic Review SIGN Filter, Embase OVID RCT SIGN Filter, CINAHL Systematic Review SIGN Filter and the CINAHL RCT SIGN Filter. The search terms used included endometriosis; endometriomas; endometriosis/diagnosis; endometriosis/drug therapy; endometriosis/complications; endometriosis/surgery and these were combined with the limits ‘English in language’ and restricted to March 2009 until January/February 2010.</p>\n<p><br />The abstracts of the identified papers were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. Articles included were good systematic reviews and RCTs, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained. </p>\n<p><br />The following summary document is based on the existing guidelines, which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain<h3>7. Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Cochrane review has shown that laparoscopic surgery gives greater improvement of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain at 6 and 12 months after surgery, than diagnostic laparoscopy alone. However, this finding should be applied with caution to women with severe endometriosis as few women with severe disease were included in this review. No conclusions regarding which specific laparoscopic surgical intervention is most effective could be drawn (Jacobson et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Similarly, a systematic review considering laparoscopic management of endometriosis demonstrated that laparoscopy is beneficial in treating endometriosis related pain at all stages of the disease, although the best way to remove lesions (excision or ablation) is unknown.  Although laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation was not found to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of endometriosis related pain, presacral neurectomy was found to be of benefit in some patients (Yeung et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />There has been continuing uncertainty about the best surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas to prevent cyst and symptom recurrence (DUETs), as well as its overall effect on quality of life (DUETs).</p>\n<p><br />A Cochrane review update is therefore helpful as it concluded that excisional surgery for endometriomas provides a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to cyst recurrence and recurrence of pain symptoms (Hart et al., 2008). Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of dysmenorrhoea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06-0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08 CI 0.01-0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02-0.56), a reduced cyst recurrence rate (OR 0.41 CI 0.18-0.93) and a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05-0.79) than surgery to ablate the endometrioma.</p>\n<p><br />In a recent trial, women were randomised to undergo immediate laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or a three step protocol, which involved endometrioma drainage, 3 months of subsequent GnRH agonist therapy and a second laparoscopy for laser coagulation of the cyst wall.  Women who underwent the three step procedure showed a greater increase in anti-Müllerian hormone level (an indicator of ovarian reserve) and a more significant increase in antral follicle count than women undergoing the single step procedure. This may indicate that ovarian function is better preserved following a three step surgical procedure, rather than the traditional single step approach (Tsolakidis, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Another paper compared the use of bipolar diathermy with suturing to achieve haemostasis after laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. This found that suturing was associated with fewer post-operative adhesions than diathermy at a “second-look” laparoscopy 60-90 days after initial surgery (Pellicano et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />Other techniques of interest are the potential benefit of using mesna (a chemical mucolytic), which appears to reduce operating time and perceived difficulty of operating, and a circular excision technique for endometriotic cysts, which also seemed to improve ease of operating. Finally, three trials have shown a benefit from the use of an adhesion barrier (Interceed, Adept or Oxiplex) during surgery for endometriosis (Yeung et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />The use of intra-operative, multi-modal analgesia (diclofenac sodium PR and repivacaine in portal sites and sub-diaphragmatically) was found to reduce post-operative total hospital opioid requirements significantly in women undergoing laparoscopic excision of endometriosis. No difference in post-operative pain intensity between the two groups was demonstrated. A reduction in post-operative opioid use with multi-modal intra-operative analgesia did not translate into a reduction in post-op sedation, nausea and vomiting or hospital stay (Costello et al, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />The use of medical treatment in combination with surgery was also addressed in one review (Yeung et al, 2009). The benefits of pre- and post-operative medical therapy are currently unclear. Two trials compared pre- and post-operative medical therapy (GnRH agonists), and found no difference in pain scores, although a reduction in r-ASRM scores in those women who had pre-operative treatment. One trial also considered the use of the LNG-IUS post-operatively, and found that it significantly improved pain scores compared to expectant management.</p>\n<p><br />The recurrence of endometriosis after treatment is of great concern to patients and gynaecologists alike. A recent review has attempted to quantify this risk, estimated to be 19% over a 2 year period. However, the authors acknowledge that the studies use very different definitions of recurrence, which makes it difficult to compare results. Several have attempted to define risk factors for recurrence, with conflicting results (Guo, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />In one RCT, women who had undergone laparoscopic excision of endometriomas were assigned to no treatment or continuous/cyclical monophasic oral contraceptive pills (OCP) for 24 months. Those women randomised to an OCP had reduced endometrioma recurrence rates compared to those on no treatment (Seracchioli et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />An additional study by the same authors, with similar methodology but greater sample size, demonstrated that dysmenorrhoea scores were lowest for the continuous OCP users throughout the 24 months. Although the reduction in dysmenorrhoea scores was not as great in cyclical OCP users, they still had lower scores than untreated women by 18 and 24 months (Seracchioli, 2009a).</p>\n<p><br />In women who had undergone conservative surgery for endometriosis, short term OCP use (6-9.5 months) after surgery does not affect recurrence rates. However, use for 24-36 months does appear to reduce the recurrence of endometriomas. One study indicated 6 months’ treatment was sufficient to reduce dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain, although a second study did not confirm this. Studies assessing long-term therapy showed a significant reduction in dysmenorrhoea at 6 months for the continuous OCP group, and by 18 months for the cyclical OCP group. A second study also showed that 2 years continuous pill taking significantly reduced dysmenorrhoea scores (Seracchioli, 2009b).<br /></p>\n<p>An RCT with five year follow-up concluded that adjuvant treatment with a GnRH agonist (for 3 months), following conservative surgery for Stage III-IV endometriosis, is not superior to expectant management in terms of preventing symptom or cyst recurrence (Loverro et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />Raloxifene (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) use for 6 months post-operatively was studied in women with pelvic pain and biopsy-confirmed endometriosis. However, there was no evidence of treatment benefit. Furthermore, when compared with those taking placebo, the raloxifene group had return of pain significantly earlier and underwent second surgery more quickly (Stratton et al, 2008).<br /></p>\n<p>A small RCT also found that the use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery for endometriosis improved pain scores at 2 and 3 months follow-up compared to conservative surgery only. The authors suggested prolonged use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery may improve long-term outcomes after surgical treatment (Kamencic et al, 2008).</p>\n<p><br />The possible benefits of dietary intervention and medical treatments on the recurrence rates of endometriomas after surgery were considered in one study. However, 6 months’ treatment with GnRH agonists, OCP or dietary intervention (vitamins, minerals, salts, lactic ferments and fish oil) did not affect the recurrence rate of endometriomas at 18 months’ follow-up (Sesti, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Uncertainty has always existed in the minds of clinicians and patients regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy for endometriosis. Unfortunately, the results of a recent Cochrane review add little to the evidence base as only two small RCTs were identified, which suggested that HRT can result in pain and disease recurrence (Al Kadri et al, 2009). However, the authors concluded that the evidence is not strong enough to advocate depriving severely symptomatic patients of HRT and there is a need for more RCTs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Costello M.F., Abbott J., Katz S., Vancaillie T. &amp; Wilson S.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Endometriosis - The clinical features and diagnosis of endometriosis<h3>5. The clinical features and diagnosis of endometriosis</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following symptoms have been associated with endometriosis:<br />• Severe dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) <br />• Deep dyspareunia (pain on intercourse) <br />• Chronic non-menstrual pain <br />• Pain at the time of ovulation <br />• Dyschezia (pain on defaecation, especially at the time of menstruation) <br />• Cyclical or perimenstrual symptoms, affecting the bowel or bladder, with or without abnormal bleeding or pain <br />• Subfertility (difficulty conceiving for more 12 months) <br />• Chronic fatigue.</p>\n<p><br />However, the predictive value of any one symptom or set of symptoms is uncertain because of the overlap with other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal disorders (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006.). The difficulties inherent in interpreting such symptoms contribute to the well-recognised delay of up to 10 years between the onset of symptoms and a surgical diagnosis.</p>\n<p><br />Endometriosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who present with such symptoms, especially if there is a cyclical component. A history and pelvic examination should be performed. There is evidence to suggest that performing the examination during menstruation helps to make the diagnosis, although many women are reluctant to be examined at that time.</p>\n<p><br />The pelvic examination may be entirely normal, but features suggestive of endometriosis include:<br />• Generalised pelvic tenderness <br />• Fixed, retroverted uterus (due to adhesions and/or deeply infiltrating disease) <br />• Tender uterosacral ligaments (nodules may also be palpable) <br />• Enlarged ovaries <br />• Seeing lesions/nodules in the vagina or on the cervix.</p>\n<p><br />The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds but it can only be confirmed on visual inspection of the peritoneal cavity at laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis. A recent review considering the value of diagnostic laparoscopy for a variety of conditions concluded that 78-84% of women undergoing laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis had the disease confirmed at surgery (Richardson, 2009). </p>\n<p><br />Histological confirmation of at least one lesion represents ideal practice, although if an endometrioma is greater than 4cms in diameter or deeply infiltrating disease is present, histology should be obtained to exclude rare instances of malignancy.</p>\n<p><br />Disease severity should be assessed by documenting in detail the type, location and extent of all lesions and adhesions found at surgery. Ideal practice is to record the findings on video or DVD as well. Disease severity can be assessed quantitatively using a classification system such as the one developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). However, there is no correlation between such systems and the type or severity of pain symptoms.</p>\n<p><br />Diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with an approximately 3% risk of minor complications, such as nausea or shoulder-tip pain, and a risk of major complications, such as bowel perforation, of between 0.6 to 1.8 per 1,000 procedures. Therefore, a non-invasive test would be clinically useful.</p>\n<p><br />The following tests have been used with varying degrees of success:<br />• Serum CA-125 (a test for ovarian cancer) – levels may be elevated in endometriosis but the test has little diagnostic value and is not recommended. <br />• Trans-vaginal ultrasound – a useful tool to make and exclude the diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma, but it has limited value in diagnosing peritoneal disease. Two studies have proposed different ways of performing ultrasound to detect deeply infiltrating endometriosis: transvaginal ‘tenderness guided’ ultrasound with 91% sensitivity and 89% specificity for vaginal disease, and 74% sensitivity and 88% specificity for rectovaginal disease (Guerriero et. al., 2008), and transrectal ultrasound in rectovaginal disease with a positive post-test prevalence probability of 93% (Griffiths et. al., 2008). The authors advocating the use of transrectal ultrasound concluded that pre-operative scanning for rectovaginal endometriosis strongly predicts the need for extensive laparoscopic dissection and potential bowel resection. <br />• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – there is insufficient evidence at present regarding its diagnostic potential; however, MRI and other imaging modalities (e.g. transrectal ultrasound, IVP, barium enema) may have a role in defining disease extent in deeply infiltrating endometriosis.</p>\n<p><br />The identification of nerve fibres may hold potential as a diagnostic test for endometriosis in the future. One study has shown 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect endometriosis by tissue biopsy (reviewed in Medina and Lebovic, 2009).</p>\n<p><br />If a woman with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis wants treatment without a definitive diagnosis, the options include counselling, analgesia and hormonal medication to reduce menstrual flow (e.g. progestagens or COC). It is unclear whether the COC should be taken conventionally, continuously or in a tricycle regimen in such circumstances.</p>\n<p><br />A gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist may be taken, although this is an expensive option and concerns exist about the effects on bone mineral density (BMD). It is also argued that establishing the correct diagnosis at laparoscopy before initiating therapy with significant short- and long-term side effects is the preferred approach (ASRM Practice Committee - Pain, 2006).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong></p>\n<p>Medina M. &amp; Lebovic D.

The pathological characteristics of endometriosis</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue in sites outside the uterine cavity, in so far as the lesions have many cellular and molecular characteristics in common with eutopic endometrium.</p>\n<p><br />The types of lesions seen are:<br />• Superficial deposits on the peritoneal or ovarian surface with a typically blue-black ‘powder-burn’ appearance, but more ‘subtle’ lesions are also recognised (e.g. petechial, vesicular, polypoid, haemorrhagic or flame-like implants). <br />• Small cysts on the peritoneal or ovarian surface containing old haemorrhage surrounded by varying degrees of fibrosis. <br />• Endometriomas (ovarian cysts), which contain thick, ‘chocolate-like’ fluid; these are usually stuck to the underlying peritoneal surface (ovarian fossa) and other structures (e.g. fallopian tube, bowel, uterus).<br />• Deep nodules infiltrating more than 5 mm below the peritoneal surface that may penetrate or adhere to other structures (e.g. bowel, bladder, ureters, vagina).</p>\n<p><br />Recent work has identified nerve fibres within the endometrium of women with endometriosis, which may lead to a better understanding of the disease process. The densities of nerve fibres, staining positive for PGP9.5 (a neuronal marker), neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were greater in the functional layer of women with endometriosis than women without the disease. Preliminary results suggest nerve fibre density is reduced in women taking hormonal therapy, as compared with those on no treatment, and the type of nerve fibres may also change (Medina and Lebovic, 2009).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2010 Annual Evidence Update</strong></p>\n<p>Medina M.G. &amp; Lebovic D.I.

Examination and investigations</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>No examination is required at the first consultation if HMB is the sole symptom. However, if: <br />• pathology (e.g. uterine fibroids) is suspected, <br />• signs or symptoms of structural or histological abnormalities are present, <br />• the suggested treatment is a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system <br />then a physical examination is required. </p>\n<p><br />If none of these are present, medical treatment can be started straight away. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Laboratory Tests</em> <br /></strong>Full blood count should be undertaken on all women with HMB to check for anaemia. <br />No other tests are routinely required, e.g. for thyroid or coagulation disorders. Evidence suggests these are not usually linked with HMB unless other signs and symptoms of these conditions are present. Where there has been HMB since adolescence and there are other symptoms or a family history suggesting a coagulation disorder, e.g. von Willebrand's disease, tests should be performed. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Ultrasound</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>In a small pilot study, contrast ultrasound has been performed using single-shot uterine instillation of a novel phase-shifting medium (1-3mL) via insemination catheter without the requirement for subsequent instrumentation. Sensitivity and specificity of anatomically determined intra-uterine pathology was 100% for contrast ultrasound, compared to 57.1% and 85.7% for conventional ultrasound (n=37). Trials determining validity, acceptability and cost-effectiveness are required but this technique may be relevant to future practice (de Ziegler, 2009).<br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>A woman should be sent for an ultrasound investigation if: <br />• the uterus is palpable abdominally <br />• pelvic examination reveals a mass of uncertain origin <br />• medical treatment has failed </p>\n<p>It is very important that the person performing the scan is appropriately trained or misleading results may be obtained.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Hysteroscopy</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>An RCT demonstrated that administration of oral drotaverine (80mg) and mefenamic acid (250mg) 1 hour prior to hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy results in significantly less procedural and post-procedural (1 hour) pain compared with Lignocaine paracervical block or intravenous sedation with diazepam and pentazocine (n=120) (Sharma et al., 2009).<br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>Hysteroscopy should only be used as a diagnostic tool when ultrasound results are inconclusive. It can assist with the exact location of a fibroid and identification of the precise nature of any abnormalities.

History taking</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU Evidence</strong> </p>\n<p>A consensus document from clinicians specialising in bleeding disorders recommends that history-taking attempts to identify bleeding tendencies (e.g. prolonged epistaxis, dental bleeding, etc.) and where these are present, thrombophilia screening is undertaken. They conclude that bleeding disorders are under-diagnosed in HMB populations, where Von Willebrand disease prevalence may be 13%, rising to 33% in adolescents. This has important implications due to different treatment strategies (James et al. 2009).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>The initial history taking is very important since it will provide information as to whether there is likely to be any pathology associated with the presence of heavy menstrual bleeding. <br /><em>In the history the nature of bleeding, potential pathology and women’s ideas concerns, expectations and needs should be established.</em> <br /><br /></p>\n<p>There are certain symptoms that may indicate the presence of pathology. These are highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>: </p>\n<p><br />• How heavy (assessed by the impact on the woman’s life) <br />• Whether the bleeding is regular or <strong>irregular</strong> <br />• <strong>Bleeding between periods or after intercourse</strong> <br />• <strong>‘Pressure’ symptoms</strong> may suggest the presence of fibroids <br />• <strong>Onset of dysmenorrhoea in the 4th or 5th decade</strong> can be associated with endometriosis or adenomyosis <br />• <strong>Abdominal pain between periods</strong> <br />• Other features that may determine treatment <em>(women’s future fertility and contraceptive plans.) <br /></em>• Women’s concerns regarding the heavy menstrual bleeding and its treatment. </p>\n<p><em></em> </p>\n<p><em>Whether menstrual blood loss is a problem should be determined by the woman and not by objective (alkaline haematin) or subjective (pictorial blood loss assessment charts) measurements.<br /></em> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 References<br /></strong><br />James, A.H., Kouides, P.A., Abdul-Kadir, R. et al.

Until quite recently, the treatment options were quite limited which partly explains why hysterectomy rates were so high in the developed world. The treatment options now, however, are considerable; as a result, clinicians and patients alike benefit from having access to high quality information about the effectiveness of the treatments available, as well as their associated complications and side-effects. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In January 2007, NICE produced a guideline summarising the best available evidence to direct clinical practice. In spite of this excellent resource, a recent evaluation of surgical interventions for menorrhagia has demonstrated significant regional and intra-regional variations in management (Cromwell et al., 2009). This indicates that there remains further scope for encouraging evidence-based management of HMB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 2007 NICE guidance was the basis for the first Annual Evidence Update on HMB hosted by NHS - women’s health. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This fourth Annual Evidence Update on HMB builds on the accumulated knowledge-base and provides an up-to-date summary of the latest evidence that has been subject to rigorous selection criteria. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Please use the links at the top of this page to access different aspects of the AEU.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women<h3>2. Impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>No new evidence was identified by our updated literature search on this topic. The information below is reproduced from our 2009 AEU. </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Definition of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)</em> </p>\n<p>HMB is highly subjective and current objective measures of HMB are not practical in clinical settings. There is also natural variability in menstrual cycle length, duration of menstruation and blood loss within the population. </p>\n<p>HMB should be defined as excessive menstrual loss which interferes with the woman’s physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms. Any interventions should aim to improve quality of life measures. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of HMB</em> </p>\n<p>The prevalence of HMB has been studied in a number of countries and clinical settings through a variety of objective and subjective measures, resulting in a wide range of estimates. </p>\n<p>Studies have suggested that approximately 10% of reproductive aged women have objective evidence of HMB; using subjective measures (self-reported information), the figure is approximately 30% (Lui et al., 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Risk Factors for increased menstrual bleeding</em> </p>\n<p>Multiple factors, including increasing age, presence of uterine fibroids and racial group have been associated with an increased risk of HMB. However, their role in causality and the effects of modifying them remain uncertain. </p>\n<p>Psychological and sociocultural factors can influence a woman’s response to menstrual blood loss, and thus must be evaluated during the consultation. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Prevalence of uterine pathology</em> </p>\n<p>The majority of women have no uterine pathology as the cause of their HMB. </p>\n<p>The most commonly found pathologies are uterine fibroids (approximately 30% of women) and polyps (approximately 10% of women). </p>\n<p>Pre-malignant and malignant pathology are rare in women presenting with HMB who have undergone investigations. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Impact of HMB on quality of life</em> </p>\n<p>It is important to recognise the major impact that HMB has on a woman’s health related quality of life (HRQoL). Evidence suggests that HMB impacts on social interaction and is associated with higher unemployment and absence from work, although it may not to be perceived by women to affect work performance. Interventions should focus on improving quality of life as opposed to focusing on menstrual blood loss. </p>\n<p>There is at present no specific HRQoL measure for HMB. Previous evidence suggests that current HRQoL measures, including Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), are not specific enough to reflect all of the HRQoL issues facing women with HMB. HMB specific quality of life measures need to be developed. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2008 AEU Evidence</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A systematic review evaluated the evidence relating to HRQoL, as well as health care costs (Lui et al., 2007). SF-36 scores from eight RCTs were included in a meta-analysis. Results suggested that women with abnormal uterine bleeding have HRQoL below the 25th percentile for the general female population. Most significantly affected areas of life were physical and emotional functioning affecting work productivity and other daily activities.  Sixteen studies using other validated HRQoL instruments found abnormal uterine bleeding to be associated with psychological morbidity, diminished sexual functioning and adverse effects on social, professional and family life. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2009 AEU Evidence</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A new paper (Frick et al., 2008) has highlighted the importance of HMB on quality of life, as well as addressing financial implications of menorrhagia. Women awaiting surgical treatment for menorrhagia were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their HRQoL, and financial considerations, including costs of sanitary protection and time off work. This study shows the reduction in quality of life measures faced by these women, as well as demonstrating that expensive surgical treatments (such as hysterectomy) may be cost effective when medical treatments for menorrhagia have failed.</p>\n<p>A further paper (Shankar et al., 2008) has also highlighted the reduction in quality of life suffered by women with HMB. It summarises a number of papers which have used tools such as the SF-36 to demonstrate a reduction in scores across all aspects of HRQoL in these women. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2009 AEU References</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Frick, K.D., Clark, M.A., Steinwachs, D.M., Langenberg, P., Stovall, D., Munro, M.G., Dickersin, K.; STOP-DUB Research Group.

Methodology</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The aim of the literature search for the 2010 Annual Evidence Update was to update the search carried out in 2009. Search strategies devised last year, based on those used by NICE, were revised and re-run for May 2009 to April 2010.  The databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Pubmed, OVID Embase and EBSCOHost CINAHL. </p>\n<p><br />Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the Pubmed Systematic Review 2 or more terms minimum difference filter, Pubmed RCT CRD/Cochrane Highly Sensitive filter, Embase OVID Systematic Review SIGN Filter, Embase OVID RCT SIGN Filter, CINAHL Systematic Review SIGN Filter and the CINAHL RCT SIGN Filter. The search terms used included menorrhagia; hypermenorrhoea; menometrorrhagia; metromenorrhagia; menstrual bleed; heavy periods; heavy menses; menstruation; heavy blood loss; dysfunctional uterine bleeding. These were combined with the terms to filter for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs, and limited to ‘English in language’. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The abstracts of the identified papers were manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. Articles included were good systematic reviews and RCTs, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following summary documents are based on the existing NICE guidelines which have been updated where new evidence has become available. These data are cited.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Heavy Menstrual Bleeding - Treatment: Surgical and non-surgical<h3>5. Treatment: Surgical and non-surgical</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Medical</h3>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Medical Treatment</strong> </p>\n<p>The NICE guideline outlines the order in which pharmaceutical treatments should be considered. The choice of treatment depends on a number of factors, particularly the woman’s desire to conceive. A second pharmacological treatment can be considered where a first has failed rather than immediate referral to surgery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>LNG-IUS</em></p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>A prospective, observational multicentre study confirmed acceptable  bleeding patterns during the first year of a second LNG-IUS, inserted immediately after expiry of the first (n=204). This suggests the LNG-IUS is a safe, viable long term solution to HMB (Gemzell-Danielsson et al., 2009).</p>\n<p>Meta-analysis of 6 RCTs comparing the effects of LNG-IUS and endometrial ablation on HMB using Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Charts, concluded that both treatments achieved similar reduction in menstrual flow and increased quality of life up to 2 years. Both first generation (TCRE) and second generation (thermal balloon) techniques were included but not separately analysed (Kaunitz et al., 2009).</p>\n<p>A further small RCT comparing the LNG-IUS and TBEA concurred that both treatments are effective for controlling HMB (n=58). Treatments achieved comparable increases in haemoglobin, but menstrual loss was significantly less in the LNG-IUS group up to 12 months. Intermenstrual bleeding was significantly less with TBEA at 6 months, but this difference disappeared by 12 months (de Souza  et al., 2010).<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) (for at least 12 months). This leads to a highly significant decrease in menstrual blood loss (MBL), but its acceptability is limited by the high incidence of irregular bleeding and spotting that can persist for many months, as well as progestagenic side effects and persistent abdominal pain. Therefore, women should be advised to persevere with treatment for at least 6 cycles in order to see a benefit. Insertion of the LNG-IUS is easier in multiparous women although data do not suggest that side effects are more common in those who have not been pregnant. Oral treatment can be commenced whilst waiting for the device to be inserted. </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A cost-utility study found that the most cost-effective treatment for HMB was the LNG-IUS, followed by ablation surgery as required (Clegg et al., 2007). In comparison with thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA), LNG-IUS was more effective at reducing MBL at 12 months, but had a slower onset of effect and was less tolerated because of side effects and continuing bleeding in a small proportion of patients (Shaw et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>Tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (taken during menses). These lead to a decrease of up to 50% in MBL. Mefenamic acid is also useful in treating dysmenorrhoea. They are very safe and need only be taken for a few days each month. However, they should be stopped if there is no benefit after 3 cycles. The combined oral contraceptive pill is also an acceptable alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong><br />A Cochrane review indicated that whilst NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in treating HMB, they were not as effective as tranexamic acid, the LNG-IUS or danazol. NSAIDs are very well tolerated with no more adverse effects than placebo. Most trials have looked at the effects of mefenamic acid, but naproxen has been shown to be as effective albeit with increased gastrointestinal side effects (Lethaby et al., 2008). </p>\n<p>Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or injected long acting progestagens (for at least 3 months). </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A Cochrane review showed a significant decrease in MBL with a 21 day course of norethisterone. The decrease was significantly less than found with LNG-IUS; however, there were also fewer unpleasant side effects such as intermenstrual bleeding and breast tenderness. The long course of progestagens has yet to be compared with other medical therapies. The review confirmed that there was no place for oral progestagens given in the luteal phase only: they are significantly less effective at reducing MBL than tranexamic acid, danazol and the LNG-IUS (Lethaby et al, 2008). </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence<br /></strong>A new RCT in perimenopausal women has confirmed that oral and intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate do reduce MBL, but that neither is as effective as the LNG-IUS (Kucuk 2008). <br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Other medical treatments: GNRHa<br /><br /></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>2010 AEU Evidence</em></strong></p>\n<p>The addition of GnRH-a to combined oral contraceptive pill therapy for HMB resulted in significantly greater reductions in blood loss, even after the first month, without hypo-oestrogenic side effects (n=58). Two injections of GnRH-a were given in the first three months and patients followed up for 6 months. Larger trials must determine long-term acceptability and compare to gold-standard therapy. The cost of GnRH-a may prohibit their routine use (Cetin et al., 2009).<br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>These are recommended prior to surgery for fibroids, or when other treatments for fibroids are contraindicated. If used for more than six months or if adverse effects are experienced (e.g. vasomotor symptoms), HRT ‘add-back’ therapy (e.g. tibolone) should be prescribed. </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence <br /></strong>Add-back HRT - either started immediately or three months into GnRH-a treatment - has been shown in an RCT to reduce the fall in bone mineral density and vasomotor symptoms associated with GnRH-a without diminishing the effect on fibroid size. Patients taking tibolone reported a higher rate of vaginal bleeding than those taking GnRH-a alone, but this is thought to be less than that experienced before treatment (Morris et al., 2008). <br /><br /><strong>2009 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A small RCT has been used to assess the effect of asoprisnil, a selective progesterone receptor modulating drug, on menorrhagia (Wilkens et al 2008). Women awaiting hysterectomy were given either asoprisnil or placebo for three months prior to their operation. Those taking aoprisnil reported a significant reduction in blood loss for the duration of treatment. Although the development of asoprisnil has been halted, this family of drugs may become clinically relevant in the future. <br /><br /></p>\n<p><em>Danazol</em> </p>\n<p>The NICE guideline states that danazol should not be routinely used to treat HMB. <br /> </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A Cochrane review found danazol to be effective in reducing MBL when compared with other available medical therapies (although it has never been compared with the LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid). It reported more adverse effects than the other drugs, particularly weight gain, acne, hirsutism and musculoskeletal pains, although this did not seem to affect its acceptability. Danazol has teratogenic effects, so women must be advised about the need for effective contraception. As yet, there is not enough evidence to recommend danazol as a treatment for HMB (Beaumont et al., 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Surgical</h3>\n<p><br /><br />Four surgical options are recommended in the NICE guideline: endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolisation (UAE), myomectomy and hysterectomy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Endometrial ablation<br /></em><em> </em></p>\n<p><em><strong>2010 AEU Evidence</strong></em></p>\n<p>Two Cochrane Reviews have recently been updated to include additional RCTs. A review of 7 RCTs comparing endometrial resection techniques to hysterectomy for treatment of HMB reiterates the superiority of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes and definitive treatment of HMB, at the cost of increased adverse events, operating time and recovery. The second review of 21 RCTs comparing first and second generation endometrial destruction techniques concludes favourability of newer techniques due to improved outcomes and fewer adverse events. Several RCTs discussed in this document have been identified for future evaluation regarding inclusion in the next Cochrane Update (Sambrook et al., 2009a, Sambrook et al., 2009b, Kleijn et al., 2008). There were no new recommendations for clinical practice.</p>\n<p>In a double-blind, randomised comparison, microwave and thermal balloon ablation techniques achieved comparable 12-month outcomes for satisfaction, amenorrhoea, menstrual scores and HRQoL (n=320). However, MEA patients required less opiates (-9%) and anti-emetics (-22%) post-operatively and had higher rates of amenorrhoea at 6months (+13%) (Sambrook et al., 2009a).</p>\n<p>A 10 year follow-up after randomisation to MEA or trans-cervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) demonstrates MEA is at least comparable to first generation techniques  in terms of satisfaction, bleeding, and quality of life outcomes (n=189). Subsequent hysterectomy rates were significantly less following MEA (17%) compared to TCRE (28%) (Sambrook et al., 2009b).</p>\n<p>A multicentre study randomising 250 women with medically-refractory menorrhagia to undergo TBEA with or without post-procedure curettage reported 37.1% amenorrhoea and 96.1% patient satisfaction at 12 months following TBEA alone. Post-procedure curettage had no effect on outcomes (Garza-Leal et al., 2009).<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>This is recommended where no pathology is found, or where there are only small fibroids. It is not suitable if a woman wants to become pregnant in the future; women should be advised to avoid pregnancy and to use appropriate contraception. </p>\n<p>Commonly used methods include microwave endometrial ablation (MEA), thermal balloon endometrial ablation (TBEA) and bipolar endometrial ablation. All methods have been subject to close scrutiny by the Health Technology Authority (HTA). </p>\n<p>TBEA has been compared to the Cavertherm thermal balloon and both were found to be equally effective (Brun et al., 2006). Ablation is probably less cost effective than the LNG-IUS although patients liked avoiding long-term therapy (Brown et al., 2006). It can also be performed successfully as an outpatient (Marsh et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A systematic review found TBEA to be an effective alternative treatment for menorrhagia resulting in reduced MBL and high satisfaction rates (Iavazzo et al., 2007).  In a comparison with the LNG-IUS, both methods demonstrated a reduction in MBL recorded by pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) and the number of days of bleeding at 12 months. The LNG-IUS had more of an effect than TBEA, but TBEA’s onset of effect was faster (Shaw et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>In an RCT comparing endometrial ablation and hysterectomy, both were effective at 24 months in solving the problem that led women to seek care (85% v. 94%), and in relieving bleeding, pain, fatigue and other symptoms. Hysterectomy was more effective at reducing bleeding, but associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and six times the infection rate of ablation. The re-operation risk at 5 years was 31% for the ablation group. (Dickersin et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A study comparing endometrial ablation in women with bleeding disorders found a significant reduction in MBL and no difference in the proportion of complications compared to controls. The advantage of this method over hysterectomy for women with bleeding disorders is to reduce the complication rate to that of the general population (El Nashar et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 5 year follow-up comparing TBEA and bipolar ablation found higher amenorrhoea rates and lower hysterectomy rates in the bipolar group. There was a significant improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in both groups (Kleijn et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 10 year follow-up of first generation ablation techniques (e.g. rollerball ablation) reported a 22% hysterectomy rate, reduced to 6% if the first treatment was successful at 2 years (Fürst et al., 2007). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Uterine artery embolisation</em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br />2010 AEU Evidence</strong></em></p>\n<p>A small pilot RCT compared UAE with the newer technique of laparoscopic occlusion of the uterine vessels (LOUV) for the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids (n=20). Both techniques were effective and comparable at reducing fibroid volume and improving menorrhagia at 6 months. Whilst LOUV has the disadvantage of requiring a general anaesthetic it resulted in significantly less post-operative pain (Ambat et al., 2009).</p>\n<p>A pilot trial of a novel technique for uterine artery occlusion via a transvaginal Doppler-guided vascular clamp, reported reduced menorrhagia symptom scores in 81% of women with corresponding reduction in uterine and dominant fibroid volume (n=30). A general anaesthetic was required and importantly 5 women developed transient hydronephrosis. More extensive trials are required (Vilos et al., 2003).<br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence<br /></strong>UAE is an effective, safe and acceptable method of treating HMB (Writing Committee for the REST Trial participants, 2007). <br />UAE is recommended as a first line treatment when fibroids are found with HMB. It potentially allows women to become pregnant in the future, but there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. <br /></p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />An RCT found UAE to be a successful alternative to hysterectomy: 81% of patients had avoided hysterectomy 2 years after a technically successful UAE (77% on an intention to treat analysis). The two treatments had comparable effects on improvement of pain and bulk symptoms (Volkers et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>A 24 month follow-up RCT of UAE v. hysterectomy found that the treatments had a comparable adverse effect on ovarian reserve. The decrease in anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) - signalling ovarian activity - remained throughout follow-up and was higher than the decrease expected through ageing alone. The study concluded that women who wish to conceive in the future should only consider UAE after counselling (Hehenkamp et al., 2007). </p>\n<p><strong>2009 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />A small double-blind RCT has highlighted the possibility that uterine artery occlusion may have benefits over embolisation: participants reported less procedural pain and required shorter hospital stays (Cunningham et al 2008). </p>\n<p>A 24 month follow-up of women randomly assigned to UAE or hysterectomy found significant improvement in HRQoL after both procedures, leading the authors to conclude that UAE is an effective alternative to hysterectomy (Hehenkamp et al 2008).</p>\n<p>A further study has found that UAE may be a more cost effective alternative to hysterectomy: on average,  UAE costs were 37% less than those associated with hysterectomy (Volkers 2008). </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Myomectomy (no new evidence)</em><br /><br /><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>Myomectomy is recommended when fibroids are found.  It potentially allows a woman to become pregnant in the future but, as with UAE, there is a risk that fibroids (and symptoms) will reoccur. </p>\n<p>In women with iron deficiency anaemia due to uterine fibroids, a single depot injection of the GnRH-a, goserelin acetate 10.8mg, with iron tablets 12 weeks before surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy), was shown to restore haemoglobin, alleviate fibroid symptoms, decrease uterine and fibroid size, and decrease bleeding more effectively than iron monotherapy. These data confirm the results of previous trials using multiple administrations of goserelin acetate and indicate that the same effects can be achieved with a single administration (Muneyyirci-Delale et al., 2007). </p>\n<p>An RCT looking at the role of cetrorelix acetate, a GnRH-a antagonist, for short term, pre-surgical treatment of fibroids, found that after one month of treatment, consisting of 4x10mg doses, uterine volume decreased by 42% (placebo 11%). After 4 weeks treatment, HMB and pain symptoms had substantially improved compared to the placebo group. However, due to the small study size and short length of follow-up it is not possible to recommend cetrorelix acetate as a treatment for HMB (Engel et al., 2006). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><em>Hysterectomy</em> (no new evidence)</p>\n<p><strong>Previous AEU Evidence</strong></p>\n<p>Hysterectomy is a very effective treatment for HMB but, in general, it is an option used when other treatments have failed or been rejected. It is associated with complications although for some areas, e.g. sexual functioning, evidence suggests that this may improve rather than deteriorate as has been supposed in the past (Halmesmaki et al., 2007). There is clearly no possibility of a woman becoming pregnant after the procedure. </p>\n<p><strong>2008 AEU Evidence</strong> <br />The studies referred to in the text above confirm the role of hysterectomy as the definitive treatment of HMB and highlight the risks associated with this form of surgery (Dickersin et al., 2007; El Nashar et al., 2007; Hehenkamp et al., 2007). <br /><br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />HMB is a common problem impacting on physical, psychological and social well-being. However, it is reasonably simple to investigate and there are a number of effective treatments available. <br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2010 References</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ambat, S., Mittal, S., Srivastava, D.N., Misra, R., Dadhwal, V. &amp; Ghosh, B.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Conservative management of stress urinary incontinence in women<h3>7. Conservative management of stress urinary incontinence in women</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jane E P Newman<br />Clinical Specialist Physiotherapist in Women’s and Men’s Health, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Conservative management is recommended as a first line treatment for stress urinary incontinence and mixed urinary incontinence in women. International studies have shown an approximate 66% improvement rate with these patients provided they are given appropriate supervision. This has been evident across the age ranges. There is evidence that women do better in a regime of exercise supervised by specialist physiotherapists and specialist continence nurses in preference to unsupervised or leaflet provided care. The reasons for this may be that in addition to exercise, specialists are likely to cover numerous other areas which may also impact on the pelvic floor such as occupation, respiratory status, lifestyle issues, overall muscle fitness, diet and general health. There is also likely to be better compliance with exercise regimes in the long term if the woman fully understands how she can help herself and if she has had adequate time to address the problem with professional support. </p>\n<p>There is evidence to suggest that women who do intensive supervised pelvic floor exercises in pregnancy reduce their chances of leakage post partum in the first year after childbirth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other studies have suggested that supervised specialist physiotherapy by members of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Women’s Health (ACPWH) or ACPWH’s ‘sister’ organisations internationally, linked as part of a multidisciplinary team are more effective than community stand alone physiotherapy in reducing the workload and operating time of surgeons. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some studies have shown a link between low back pain in women and urinary incontinence and suggest the need to include core stability exercises for the low back when teaching a pelvic floor regime.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Criteria for inclusion in a conservative management regime:</p>\n<ul><li>Compliant well motivated women</li>\n<li>Suggestion of a weak pelvic floor on vaginal assessment with evidence that there is adequate muscle tissue to develop</li>\n<li>Suggestion on history taking of lifestyle issues which may be impacting on the pelvic floor </li>\n<li>Symptomatic young women who are of child bearing age who may get pregnant in the future</li>\n<li>Women where surgery is inappropriate for medical reasons</li>\n<li>Women with multiple problems in the pelvis where the pelvic floor may be having an impact on function e.g. pelvic pain and Dyspareunia</li>\n<li>Women who have developed some degree of urinary leakage in pregnancy or in the early post natal period</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p>Assessment should include:</p>\n<ul><li>Detailed history of the ongoing nature of the urinary problem, previous treatment, frequency, urgency and function</li>\n<li>Detailed assessment of bowel habits and function to establish possible links between the anterior and posterior compartments of the pelvic floor and the possible need to liaise with the colo-rectal team</li>\n<li>Detailed assessment of the woman’s respiratory status and the need to liaise with the woman’s GP if care is required as for example in the case of a chronic cough aggravating symptoms in the pelvic floor</li>\n<li>Detailed vaginal and pelvic assessment to establish the impact of the pelvic muscles in the mid line, the strength and endurance of these muscles, the impact and strength of the deep abdominal muscles (Transversus Abdominus)</li>\n<li>Assessment of the woman’s lifestyle, working patterns and dietary patterns to establish whether any of these are impacting adversely on the pelvic floor</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p>Treatment may include:</p>\n<ul><li>An explanation of the function and anatomy of the pelvic floor</li>\n<li>An intensive regime of supervised pelvic floor exercise</li>\n<li>An ‘outcome diary’ linking pain, function, diet and leakage with lifestyle and activities to try to educate the woman in how best to help herself</li>\n<li>Liaison with the others in the multi disciplinary team whether in the community or hospital setting to ensure contributing factors are addressed adequately. This may include discussion regarding medical management of mixed incontinence in relation to medication as there is evidence that these patients do best on a combined approach of conservative and drug regimes</li>\n<li>A supporting ‘hand out’ as an exercise and lifestyle reminder</li>\n<li>Various biofeedback regimes – these may include electrical stimulation</li>\n<li>Supporting exercise regimes for the core trunk stability muscle groups where these are also affected</li>\n<li>Advice on avoiding increasing symptoms, by poor bowel function e.g. constipation or straining, lifting or moving excessive weights and chronic respiratory conditions</li>\n<li>Education of the woman in bladder regulating patterns to try to re-establish a normal bladder pattern</li>\n<li>An explanation of why conservative management is not effective and why an exercise regime has failed to cure the urinary problem</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p>Follow on care:</p>\n<ul><li>Evidence suggests that women need to be encouraged to continue with a long term program of pelvic floor exercises for the benefits to be maintained</li>\n<li>There needs to be close liaison between those providing conservative management and providers of more interventionist treatments such as surgery and medical management, to provide a seamless progression if the conservative treatments do not work</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p><strong>Additional note on mixed urinary incontinence</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Many of the patients with mixed stress and urge incontinence will also benefit through the above conservative management. Numbers vary in different studies but good practice suggests that a multi-disciplinary approach of combined medication and conservative care may be beneficial</li></ul><p> </p>\n<p><strong>Useful links<br /></strong><a href=\"http://www.acpwh.org.uk/\">www.acpwh.org.uk</a> (Membership is by examination as a post graduate branch of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy)<br /><a href=\"http://www.csp.org.uk/\">www.csp.org.uk</a> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>2010 AEU References<br /></strong>1.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Methodology<h3>1. Methodology</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />The aim of the literature search for the 2010 annual evidence update was to update the search carried out in 2009.</p>\n<p>The search strategies used last year were updated and re-run. Databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID Embase, Pubmed and EBSCOHOST CINAHL. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were specifically targeted, using a combination of the Pubmed Systematic Review (2 or more terms min difference) filter, the Pubmed RCT (CRD/Cochrane Highly Sensitive) filter, the SIGN Embase Systematic Review filter, the SIGN Embase RCT filter, the SIGN Cinahl Systematic Review filter and the SIGN Cinahl RCT filter. The search terms used included urinary incontinence; stress incontinence; overactive bladder; urge incontinence; Botulinum; sacral nerve stimulation; conservative management; quality of life. These were combined with sub-headings including: drug therapy; surgery. Limits such as ‘English in language’, adult and female were applied and the search was also restricted to the date range 2008 to 2009.</p>\n<p><br />The retrieved references were sifted by members of the expert panel to identify all the good quality papers. These papers were then manually inspected to determine their relevance and appropriateness for inclusion in this document. Articles included were good systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials, and less robust studies where they were considered to illustrate a point of controversy or indicate a possible future direction for the management of the condition. When a paper was to be included, or where doubt existed over the appropriateness of the data, the full-text was obtained. Summaries were then written based on the NICE guideline and the summaries written for the 2009 AEU to which has been added any new evidence where this has become available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.library.nhs.uk/womenshealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=334876&amp;tabID=289&amp;catID=6055\">Link back to AEU Contents page</a></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Pharmacotherapy for Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB)<h3>2. Pharmacotherapy for Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB)</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Dr Natalia Price, Subspeciality trainee in Urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson, Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.<br /></p>\n<p><br /><strong>Background</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />The overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a condition defined as urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence and usually with frequency and nocturia [Abrams et al., 2003]. Pharmacological suppression of detrusor overactivity with anticholinergics (antimuscarinics) is the most widely used treatment for this condition. Anticholinergic drugs block the muscarinic receptors that mediate detrusor smooth-muscle contruction and have a direct, relaxing effect on the detrusor muscle.  There are a number of drug treatments available. They differ in their selectivity for various muscarinic receptors and some drugs have additional actions, such as direct smooth muscle effects. There is no evidence of any clinically important difference in efficacy between these antimuscarinic drugs. Based on a cost minimisation analysis, non-proprietary immediate-release oxybutynin is the most cost effective antimuscarinic drug [NICE, 2006]. Adverse effects are common with all antimuscarinic drugs and, therefore, early review of treatment is good practice. Oestrogen replacement has been promoted as a solution to urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women. Oestrogens help to maintain the health of tissues that are essential for normal pressure transmission in the urethra. </p>\n<p><br /><strong>NICE guideline recommendations 2006</strong></p>\n<p><br /><em>Recommendations for anticholinergic drugs</em></p>\n<p>Immediate release non-proprietary oxybutynin should be offered to women with OAB or mixed urinary incontinence (UI) as first-line antimuscarinic drug treatment, if bladder training has been ineffective. If immediate-release oxybutynin is not well tolerated, darifenacin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium or an extended release or transdermal formulation of oxybutynin should be considered as alternatives. Women should be counselled about the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs. An early treatment review should be undertaken following any change in antimuscarinic drug therapy. Propiverine should be considered as an option to treat frequency of urination in women with OAB, but is not recommended for the treatment of UI. Flavoxate, propantheline and imipramine should not be used for the treatment of UI or OAB in women.</p>\n<p><br /><em>Recommendations for oestrogens</em></p>\n<p>Systemic hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for the treatment of UI. Intravaginal oestrogens are recommended for the treatment of OAB symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy. </p>\n<p><br /><strong>New evidence for anticholinergic preparations</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />Pharmacological suppression of detrusor overactivity with anticholinergics remains to be the mainstay of OAB pharmacotherapy. There have been number of placebo-controlled randomised studies of antimuscarinic drugs and comparison RCT of the drugs in the recent years, as well as systematic reviews of available preparations [Hay-Smith et al., 2005; Chapple et al., 2005; Nabi et al., 2006].</p>\n<p><br /><em>Oxybutynin, propiverine, tolterodine and trospium chloride</em> have been used for many years to treat OAB symptoms. Sustained release oxybutynin transdermal patches, which release 3.9mg every 24 hours, have recently been launched in the UK [Nabi et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 2006; Bang et al., 2003]. </p>\n<p><br /><em>Solifenacin and  darifenacin</em> are newer bladder-selective anticholinergic preparations. They are more recent useful additions to the list of available drugs and may possibly have a lower incidence of adverse effects. Solifenacin is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. At 5mg and 10mg daily dosing it reduces the frequency of daily voids and number of urge and incontinence episodes. Efficacy has been observed as early as within one week of starting treatment. Darifenacin is a highly selective M3 receptor antagonist available in 7.5 or 15 mg once-daily sustained-release form [Brunton and Kuritzky, 2005; Hill et al., 2006]. </p>\n<p><br /><em>Fesoterodine</em> is the latest addition to the available list of drugs. It is a nonselective oral antimuscarinic agent that exerts its pharmacologic effects as a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Fesoterodine acts as a prodrug; when administered, it is rapidly hydrolysed by nonspecific esterases to the active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT). After oral dosing, the parent compound is not detectable in plasma. The main active metabolite of fesoterodine, 5-HMT, is identical to the active metabolite of tolterodine; 5-HMT is formed from tolterodine by cytochrome P450 2D6–mediated oxidation in the liver. Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine 4 and 8 mg resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in bothersome OAB symptoms compared with placebo. Treatment effects appeared to be more pronounced with fesoterodine 8 mg than with tolterodine ER 4 mg or fesoterodine 4 mg, especially regarding urge incontinence episodes and volume voided per micturition. [Chapple et al., 2007; Nitti et al., 2007].</p>\n<p><br />In patients with refractory overactive bladder double anticholinergic therapy can be considered as an efficient and serious alternative to surgery [Balduc et al., 2009]. However, the recent studies showed that anticholinergic medications are often poorly tolerated and its discontinuation rates for are quite high. With the exception of trospium chloride, all drugs had continuation rates of less than 50% at 6 months, less than 25% at 1 year, and less than 10% at 2 years and longer. Trospium chloride, however, exhibited continuation rates of 46% at 6 months, 36% at 1 year, 22% at 2 years, and 16% at 3 years [Brostrom and Hallas, 2009; Gopal et al., 2008].</p>\n<p>Antidiuresis, using oral desmopressin can provide an alternative method of treatment to OAB sufferers. By decreasing kidney urine production, it prolongs bladder filling-time thereby increasing the time to reach maximum capacity, thus reducing overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms [Hashim et al., 2009].<br /> <br />Many new promising compounds are emerging, which target key the molecular pathways involved in micturition control but effective nonantimuscarinic treatments for OAB are currently scarce [Sacco et al., 2008]. The most promising potential therapeutic targets include: nervous GABAergic, glycinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems; b-drenoceptors and cAMP metabolism; nonadrenergic–noncholinergic mechanisms such as purinergic and neuropeptidergic systems; vanilloid receptors; bladder afferent nerves; nonneuronal bladder signaling systems including urothelium and interstitial cells; prostanoids; Rho-kinase; and different subtypes of potassium and calcium channels. Despite the enormous amount of new biologic insight, very few drugs with mechanism of action other than antimuscarinics have passed as yet the proof-of-concept stage. Further preclinical and clinical studies are urgently needed in this rapidly moving field.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>New evidence for oestrogens</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><br />Very little further evidence has become available since publication of the NICE guideline, Urinary incontinence in women (NICE, 2006). Short-term studies of intravaginal oestrogens suggest some improvement in symptoms of incontinence and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. There is little evidence from the trials on the clinical effectiveness period after oestrogen treatment had finished and none about long-term effects.<br />Systemic oestrogen treatment does not confer any benefit in women with UI and there is evidence that it may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence in postmenopausal women [Cody et al., 2009]. There were too few data to reliably address other aspects of oestrogen therapy, such as oestrogen type and dose, and no direct evidence on route of administration. A combination of vaginal estrogen cream and anticholinergics is a benefitial therapy for postmenopausal women with OAB [Tseng et al., 2009].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Antimuscarinics remains to be the mainstay of the medical therapy for overactive bladder. Intravaginal oestrogens provide some improvement in symptoms of incontinence and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. Despite the enormous amount of new biologic insight, very few drugs with mechanism of action other than antimuscarinics have passed as yet the proof-of-concept stage. Further preclinical and clinical studies are urgently needed in this rapidly moving field.<br /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong><br />1.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Pharmacotherapy for stress urinary incontinence<h3>5. Pharmacotherapy for stress urinary incontinence</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspeciality trainee in urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson, Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stress urinary incontinence (stress UI) is a common, distressing condition known adversely to affect quality of life. Until recently the only available treatments were conservative measures, lifestyle modification and a variety of surgical procedures. </p>\n<p><br />Duloxetine is the first drug to be licensed for the treatment of stress UI. It is a potent balanced serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. The inhibition of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake during bladder storage is thought to increase pudendal nerve output, resulting in increased tone of the rhabdosphincter and subsequently improved urethral closure. Duloxetine has been evaluated in phase II and phase III clinical trials and was found to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of women with moderate to severe stress UI symptoms. <br /></p>\n<p>Oestrogen replacement has been promoted as a solution to UI in postmenopausal women, although its chief mode of action is unclear. Oestrogens help to maintain the health of tissues that are essential for normal pressure transmission in the urethra. These include the sphincter muscles, urothelium and vascular tissues, as well as the urethral secretions that may help to create a ‘seal’. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>NICE guideline</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Recommendations for duloxetine</strong></em></p>\n<p>Duloxetine is not recommended as a first-line treatment for women with predominant stress UI.</p>\n<p><br />Duloxetine should not routinely be used as a second-line treatment for women with stress UI, although it may be offered as second-line therapy if women prefer pharmacological to surgical treatment or are not suitable for surgical treatment. If duloxetine is prescribed, women should be counselled about its adverse effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Recommendations for oestrogens</strong></em></p>\n<p>Systemic hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for the treatment of UI. </p>\n<p><br />Intravaginal oestrogens are recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>New evidence</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Evidence for duloxetine</strong></em></p>\n<p>There have been further studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of duloxetine but there is still a lack of long-term safety data. Recent evidence from randomized placebo controlled trials have shown it to be significantly more effective than placebo in reducing incontinence episode frequency and improving quality of life scores [Bump, 2008; Millard et al., 2004; Bent et al., 2007; Van Kerrebroeke et al., 2004]. <br /> </p>\n<p>However, adverse effects, particularly nausea, and discontinuation rates are very common. Sixty-eight percent of patients discontinued duloxetine within the first 4 weeks of commencing treatment because of the adverse effects [Duckett et al., 2007]. In one cohort study only 9% of patients were still taking duloxetine one year later [Vella et al., 2008]. The main reasons for discontinuation were intolerance of duloxetine’s side effects and perceived lack of efficacy. </p>\n<p><br />The data also suggest that the 20 mg BID dose escalation regimen may contribute to a decrease in the adverse event related discontinuation rate for women taking duloxetine. The results of one trial demonstrate that starting duloxetine treatment at a dose of 20 mg BID for 2 weeks before increasing the dose to the optimally effective 40 mg BID dose significantly reduced the risk of nausea and dizziness [Bump et al., 2007]. </p>\n<p><br />In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that duloxetine treatment can improve the quality of life of patients with stress urinary incontinence but it is unclear whether or not the benefits are sustainable. The commonest adverse effect was nausea and many women stopped the treatment as a consequence. Treatment with duloxetine can be considered in women not suitable for surgical treatment or awaiting surgery. If duloxetine is prescribed, women should be counselled about its adverse effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Evidence  for oestrogens</strong></em></p>\n<p>Local oestrogen treatment may improve or cure urinary incontinence but there is little evidence from the trials on the period after oestrogen treatment had finished and none about long-term effects [Cody et al., 2009]. Short-term studies of intravaginal oestrogens suggest some improvement in symptoms of incontinence in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to vaginal atrophy. Topical conjugated equine oestrogens and estriol were effective in increasing the number of periurethral vessels in postmenopausal women with urinary stress incontinence, with conjugated equine oestrogens being the most effective intervention studied [Kobata et al., 2008].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Systemic oestrogen treatment does not confer any benefit in women with UI and there is evidence that it may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence in postmenopausal women. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong><br />1.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Sacral neuromodulation for urinary storage and voiding dysfunction<h3>3. Sacral neuromodulation for urinary storage and voiding dysfunction</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspeciality trainee in Urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson, Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The impact of incontinence on quality of life, and therefore the importance of managing it as effectively as possible, can scarcely be overemphasised. Control of storage of urine and bladder emptying is achieved by a complex interaction between the structures supporting the bladder and urethra and the higher brain centres and peripheral nerves. A disruption at any level can interfere with normal urine storage and voiding. Neurogenic disruption can result from proven neurological disease or trauma (for example spinal cord injury). Similar changes can also occur without overt neurological damage where the patient may have an overactive bladder or one that does not void properly. Electrical nerve stimulation (neuromodulation) has been used to try to overcome these problems. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sacral nerve stimulation (neuromodulation)</em> is a least-invasive surgical procedure used in management of refractory symptoms of urinary incontinence and voiding dysfunction. Patients offered such surgery have usually failed several more conservative types of management by the time implants are contemplated.  Neuromodulation uses the principle of electrical stimulation of the sacral reflex pathway to inhibit the reflex behaviour of the bladder. Nerve stimulation can be achieved using surface electrodes or transcutaneous needles, or electrodes implanted close to nerves.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Initially, an electrode is placed via the sacral foramen alongside a sacral nerve (usually S3). In a second procedure, the electrode is connected by cables under the skin to an implanted programmable pulse generator that provides stimulation within set stimulation parameters. Implantation of the pulse generator is usually carried out only after a successful trial of percutaneous (skin surface) nerve evaluation (PNE). If PNE is regarded as successful, the patient then proceeds to full implantation with the pulse generator. The technology has been used for patients with overactive bladders, urgency incontinence, and voiding (retention of urine) difficulties, and for some patients with defaecation problems. It has also been used in the management of chronic pelvic pain, although this indication is not included in this review. </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>NICE guideline 2006 recommendations on use of sacral nerve stimulation</strong></p><strong>\n<p><br /></p></strong>Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is recommended for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity in women who have not responded to conservative treatments. Women should be offered sacral nerve stimulation on the basis of their response to preliminary percutaneous nerve evaluation. Life-long follow-up is recommended.\n<p><br /><strong>New evidence</strong></p><strong></strong>\n<p><br />Two systematic reviews and several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published recently [Brazzelli et al., 2006; Latini et al., 2006; Hassouna et al., 2000; Van Kerrebroek et al., 2007; Herbison and Armold 2009; Van Voskuilen et al., 2006; Van Voskuilen, 2007].  In the randomised trials, about 50% of patients in the stimulation group achieved complete continence or an improvement greater than 90% in the main incontinence symptoms, while a 50% improvement in the main incontinence symptoms was observed in about 87% of patients. In addition, in the case-series studies the benefits of neuromodulation were reported to persist at follow-up of three to five years after implantation. All studies considered SNS in the S3 foramen via an implanted device. Most studies included men and women. The findings are consistent across the different indications of urinary urge incontinence, urgency or frequency, and urinary retention. A satisfaction rate of 68% was reported at mean follow-up of 2 years in one study. Three studies found significant improvement in quality of life (QOL) at 18 months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Urodynamic evaluation before and 6 months after implantation of SNS showed a statistically significant improvement in bladder volumes at first sensation of filling and at maximum fill volume [Groenendijk, 2008]. Patients with urge incontinence (IU) but no detrusor overactivity (DO) had a higher rate of clinical success (73%) than patients with UI and DO (61%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, SNS in patients with UI without confirmed DO was at least as successful as patients with UI and DO. Therefore in patients with UI, DO should not necessarily be a prerequisite selection criterion for using SNS [Groenendijk, 2008].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Extremely interesting are the findings of a functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigating the effect of sacral neuromodulation on brain responses in women with Fowler's syndrome (FS) [Kavia et al., 2009]. This showed that brain responses to bladder filling are abnormal in FS. Apparently, a normal mechanism for suppression of incontinence involving the striated urethral sphincter becomes exaggerated in FS and prevents voiding. Sacral neuromodulation seems to act at the sacral level, by blocking inhibition by urethral afferents and therefore restoring normal voiding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Complications</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Most complications observed in the studies were the result of technical problems related to implantation of the device. The results of the systematic review showed that, overall, the re-operation rate for patients with implants was 33% (283/860). The most common reasons for surgical revision were to replace or reposition implants due to pain or infection at the implant site, or to adjust and modify the lead system to correct breakage or migration. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pain at the site of the pulse generator or at the site of stimulation was reported in 24% (162/663) of patients, sometimes requiring replacement and repositioning of the pulse generator. Other complications included lead-related problems, such as migration (16%), wound problems (7%), adverse effects on bowel function (6%), and infection (5%). Surgical intervention for these complications was reported in between 7% and 66% (median 22%) of patients. Removal of the implant was required in 4-11% (median 7%). Other adverse effects were cases of seroma formation, disturbed bowel function (1-7%), wound dehiscence or infection (3-15%), infection (2-9%), toe flexion (8%) and pain (abdominal, leg, pelvis and gluteal incision) (2-20%). No cases of long-lasting neurological complications were identified.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> </p>\n<p><br />Recent evidence continues to support sacral neuromodulation as a safe and effective long-term treatment for of urinary incontinence and voiding dysfunction in appropriately selected cases refractory to other forms of treatment. Up to two-thirds of patients achieve continence or substantial improvement in symptoms after SNS, and the available data show that beneficial effects appear to persist for up to 3-5 years after implantation. Around one-third of patients may require re-operation, most often owing to pain at the implant site, infection, or the need for adjustment and modification of the lead system. Other treatment options for women who have not responded to conservative treatments are all costly and associated with significant morbidity. Therefore, there is a stronger body of evidence to support the use of sacral nerve stimulation than procedures such as augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong><br />1.

    "description": "111-12010 Annual Evidence Update on Urinary Incontinence - Surgery for stress urinary incontinence in women<h3>6. Surgery for stress urinary incontinence in women</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspeciality trainee in Urogynaecology,<br />Mr Simon R Jackson, Consultant Urogynaecologist,<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stress urinary incontinence (stress UI) is defined as the complaint of involuntary urine leakage on effort or exertion or on sneezing or coughing without rise in detrusor pressure. It is estimated to affect up to one-third of women older than the age of 18 years, with a median age of 45 years. The large number of different surgical procedures described for stress UI in women reflects the continuing search for a procedure that can successfully deal with all cases. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1997-98 approximately 8000 operations for stress UI were carried out in England over a 12-month period. By 2004-05 the annual number had increased by 16%, despite an approximately 90% reduction in the numbers of colposuspension and a 30-50% reduction in bladder neck buttress and periurethral injection procedures. This increase was entirely due to the rapid introduction of tension-free vaginal tape and similar mid-urethral tape procedures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><br />NICE (2006) recommendations on surgical management of stress UI</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br />Retropubic mid-urethral tape procedures using a ‘bottom-up’ approach with macroporous (type 1) polypropylene meshes are recommended as treatment options for stress UI if conservative management has failed. Synthetic slings using a retropubic ‘top-down’ or a transobturator foramen approach are recommended as alternative treatment options, provided women are made aware of the lack of long-term outcome data. Synthetic slings using materials other than polypropylene that are not of a macroporous (type 1) are not recommended for the treatment of stress UI. </p>\n<p><br />Open colposuspension and autologous rectus fascial sling are the recommended alternatives when clinically appropriate. </p>\n<p><br />Laparoscopic colposuspension is not recommended as a routine procedure for the treatment of stress UI in women. The procedure should be performed only by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon working in a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the assessment and treatment of UI.</p>\n<p><br />Intramural bulking agents should be considered for the management of stress UI if conservative management has failed. Women should be made aware that repeat injections may be required to achieve efficacy; efficacy diminishes with time and the efficacy is inferior to that of a retropubic suspension or sling. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>New evidence<br /></strong><br /><strong><em><br />Laparoscopic colposuspension<br /><br /></em></strong><br />Recently published studies suggest that laparoscopic colposuspension is probably as durable as the open procedure. There have been ten trials in which laparoscopic was compared with open colposuspension. These showed the advantages of laparoscopy to include decreases in blood loss, postoperative pain, hospital stay and duration of catheterisation. However, laparoscopy did increase operative times by a mean of 13.7 minutes. There were no statistically significant differences in objective cure, de-novo detrusor overactivity and voiding dysfunction between laparoscopy and laparotomy. Subjective cure rates were in the range 58-96% in the laparotomy group and 62-100% in the laparoscopy group [Dean et al., 2006a; Kitchener et al., 2006]. However, a ten year follow-up study showed that the cure rates for both procedures appear to deteriorate over time [Barr et al., 2009]. Significantly higher subjective and objective one-year cure rates were found for women randomised to two paravaginal sutures compared with one suture in a single trial [Persson et al., 2000]. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the advent of polypropylene mid-urethral slings for stress UI, the purpose of laparoscopy for continence procedures has been questioned. In eight studies laparoscopic colposuspension has been compared with suburethral polypropele vaginal slings [Dean et al., 2006b; Jelovsek et al., 2008]. There were no significant differences in the reported subjective cure rates of the two procedures but objective cure rates at 18 months favoured slings. No significant differences were observed for postoperative voiding dysfunction and perioperative complications. Laparoscopic colposuspension had a significantly longer operation time and hospital stay. </p>\n<p><br />In conclusion, short-term results favour mid-urethral slings over laparoscopic colposuspension. If laparoscopic colposuspension is performed, the use of two paravaginal sutures appears to be the most effective method.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong><em>Retropubic versus transobturator tapes</em></strong></p>\n<p>Several studies, including twelve randomised controlled trials (RCT), have compared transobturator (TOT) and retropubic vaginal tapes for treatment of stress UI. Most of these studies reported no significant difference in effectiveness between the two techniques [Latthe et al., 2007]. However, two of the most recent RCTs have shown that the retropubic TVT operation is more effective than the TOT procedure in women with urodynamic stress incontinence and intrinsic sphincter deficiency, with the risk of repeat surgery being 2.6 times higher after use of the transobturator tape [Rechberger and Futyma, 2009; Schielitz et al., 2008].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The transobturator tape appears to be associated with fewer complications of bladder injury and voiding difficulty but more groin pain and vaginal mesh erosion. The reduced risk of voiding difficulty may appear to make the transobturator tape preferable in women with borderline flow rates, although this has not been investigated specifically in this subgroup of women. The low risk of bladder injury might also make TOT an option of choice in women who have had previous operations such as colposuspension, where the bladder could be tethered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Methodologically sound and sufficiently powered RCTs with long-term follow-up are needed and the results of continuing trials are awaited.    </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Single-incision sub-urethral short tape</strong></em> </p>\n<p>A single-incision mini-sling has being introduced in the last couple of years. The data on the efficacy and morbidity of this new minimally invasive procedure is very limited [Karram et al., 2007; Marsh and Assassa, 2007]. One prospective multi-centre trial reported one-year subjective and objective cure rates of 78% and 81%, respectively [Meschia et al., 2009]. Long-term follow-up is warranted and comparative studies are needed to determine its true safety and efficacy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Efficacy of repeat TVT sling procedures</em></strong></p>\n<p>Current evidence on the efficacy of tension-free vaginal tape as a repeat procedure in the management of recurrent urodynamic stress incontinence is still very limited. One relatively small but clinically important study assessed the efficacy and indications of the TVT procedure after a previous failed midurethral sling procedure. It showed that the TVT procedure, as a second operation, could provide an overall cure rate of 74% with a low complication rate after a previous failed midurethral tape procedure [Liapis, 2009].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Impact of surgery for stress urinary incontinence on female sexual function</em></strong><br /> <br />Several studies have looked at the impact of surgery for stress urinary incontinence on female sexual function. The results suggest that anti-incontinence surgery can have positive and negative outcomes on sexual function, with no significant differences between Burch colposuspension and the sling procedures. In the majority of cases, women report that their sexual function is improved or unchanged by this type of surgery, although the risk of developing dyspareunia (&lt;15%) is not negligible [Brubaker et al., 2009; Sentilhes et al., 2009; Serati et al., 2009].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>New developments</strong> <br /><br /><strong><em><br />Use of adult muscle derived stem cells<br /><br /></em></strong>Preclinical studies have suggested that transurethral injections of autologous myoblasts can assist in regeneration of the rhabdosphincter, and fibroblasts in reconstruction of the urethral submucosa.</p>\n<p><br />In one clinical study the efficacy and safety of the application of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts for treating female stress UI were assessed. One year after implanting the cells, 79% of the women were completely continent, 13% had a substantial improvement in continence and 8% a slight improvement [Strasser et al., 2007a]. The same authors conducted a RCT comparing transurethral ultrasonography-guided injections of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies with standard transurethral endoscopic injections of collagen and found treatment with autologous stem cell effective and safe [Strasser et al., 2007b].</p>\n<p><br />This novel treatment appears promising but more substantial data are required before it can be implemented into clinical practice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2010 AEU References</h3>\n<p><br />1.

Use of Botulinum toxin in management of Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB)</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr Natalia Price, Subspeciality trainee in Urogynaecology<br />Mr Simon R Jackson, Consultant Urogynaecologist.<br />Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Background </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a common condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life. Currently accepted practice is to offer lifestyle or behavioural modifications or antimuscarinic medications as initial treatments. </p>\n<p><br />Where these are unsuccessful, a range of surgical interventions may be considered. These aim to increase the capacity of the bladder, alter or modulate its nerve supply and contractility, or to bypass the lower urinary tract completely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intravesical injection of botulinum toxin is increasingly used as an intervention for refractory overactive bladder, with a considerable body of case reports and series in the literature suggesting beneficial effects. Botulinum toxin is an extremely potent neurotoxin derived from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxins type A and B (botulinum toxin-A and BTX-B) are currently marketed under the trade names Botox and Dysport, and are used as muscle paralytic agents for conditions such as torticollis and in cosmetic medicine to relax frown lines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The rationale for using botulinum toxin in overactive bladder syndrome is that detrusor paralysis should reduce the symptoms of bladder overactivity. The toxin is injected into the detrusor walls cystoscopically, usually avoiding the trigone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>NICE guideline 2006 recommendations on use of botulinum toxin</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Bladder wall injection with botulinum toxin A should only be used in the treatment of idiopathic detrusor overactivity in women who have not responded to conservative treatments and who are willing and able to self-catheterise. Women should be informed about the lack long-term on efficacy and safety. Botulinum toxin B is not recommended for the treatment of women with idiopathic OAB. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p><strong>New evidence</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Data on the use of botulinum toxin A in the management of idiopathic detrusor overactivity are still limited. The available data show cure or improvement of up to 90%, with duration of benefit between 3 and 12 months. Botulinum toxin B appears to be effective only in the short term (up to 6 weeks).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A)</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Several randomised placebo-controlled trials [Sahai et al., 2007; Kuo, 2007; Brubaker et al., 2008; Flynn et al., 2009; Sahai et al., 2009; Schulte-Baukloh et al., 2008; White et al., 2008] have evaluated BTX-A for the treatment of refractory OAB, compared to placebo or conservative treatment. However, patient numbers in these studies were small and included both men and women. The duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months. The doses injected varied, ranging from 100 to 300 units (BOTOX) and 500 to 1000iu (DYSPORT), into 10–40 sites in the bladder wall. Intravesical BTX-A does appear to reduce incontinence when compared with placebo, with the reported results:</p>\n<ul><li>cure or improvement rates of 60–96% at 3 weeks to 12 months follow-up [Sahai et al., 2007; Kuo, 2007; Brubaker et al., 2008; Flynn et al., 2009; Sahai et al., 2009; Schulte-Baukloh et al., 2008; White et al.,  2008].</li>\n<li>mean duration of response to a single dose of 24 weeks (range 10–52 weeks).</li></ul><p>Intravesical BTX-A injections ameliorates all OAB symptoms within the first week after treatment, but urgency is most rapidly and consistently affected, suggesting an early effect on bladder afferent pathways [Kalsi et al., 2008]. The most common complication reported were voiding dysfunction and urinary retention (ranging from 3-5% to up to 43%), which usually resolved by 9 months [Kuo, 2006; Jeffery et al., 2007; Brubaker et al., 2008]. Other complications reported were haematuria, pelvic pain, transient dysuria and UTI.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Low doses of BTX-A (100U BOTOX) appeared to result in similar rates of improvement and were associated with significantly fewer adverse events (eg. urinary retention), compared with doses of 150 or 200 U. However, the duration of therapeutic effectiveness was significantly shorter for the patients treated with 100 U compared with that for those treated with 150 or 200 U of BTX-A [Kuo, 2006].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Injections of BTX-A into detrusor muscle and suburothelial injections achieve a similar therapeutic effect on idiopathic detrusor overactivity. One RCT compared injections of 100 U BTX-A into detrusor muscle with suburothelial injections. A successful result at 3 months was achieved in 93% in the detrusor group and 80% in the suburothelial injection group [Kuo, 2007].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Increasing evidence suggests that sensory nerve dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of OAB and, for this reason, targeting the afferent innervation of the bladder trigone during injection may provide clinical benefit. One study compared trigone or trigone-sparing injection of BTX-A. No significant difference in symptom score or treatment response was noted between the trigone and trigone-sparing groups. Further studies are needed to evaluate possible benefit of trigonal injection [Lucioni et al., 2006].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The efficacy of two types of botulinum toxin type A, Dysport (Ipsen Ltd, Slough, UK) and Botox (Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), was assessed in an open-label case-control study. The patients were treated with either Dysport (500, 750, or 1000 IU), or with Botox (300 IU). There were no significant differences in the results between the groups [Grosse et al., 2009].</p>\n<p><br />Botulinum toxin type A antibodies can develop after injection of BTX-A and can lead to therapy failure. In patients with clinically complete therapy-failure, in whom no obvious other causes can be determined (such as a progressive disease in a patient with multiple sclerosis), screening for BTX-A antibodies should be carried out [Schulte-Baukloh et al., 2005].</p>\n<p><br />Treatment with Botulinum toxin A injections is cost-effective compared to anticholinergic medications for the treatment of refractory urge incontinence [White et al., 2008].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Botulinum toxin B (BTX-B)</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>The efficacy of BTX-B in the treatment of refractory idiopathic DO in men and women has been evaluated in one placebo-controlled RCT [Ghei et al., 2005]. BTX-B was found to have a limited duration of action, with most of its symptomatically beneficial effects wearing off by 10 weeks in most of patients. Transient adverse effects were urinary retention, constipation and dry mouth [Ghei et al., 2005; Hirst et al., 2007].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The short duration of action for BTX-B suggests that it is unlikely to gain widespread use in the treatment of OAB. Its use will presumably be limited to patients who have experienced tachyphylaxis with botulinum toxin A.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\n<p>Intravesical botulinum toxin shows promise as a therapy for overactive bladder symptoms, but as yet too little controlled trial data exists on benefits and safety. Furthermore, the optimal dose of botulinum toxin for efficacy and safety has not yet been established. It must be recognised that the therapeutic use of intravesical BTX is relatively recent and that the long-term effects are unknown at this stage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the limited available evidence, the use of botulinum toxin A is rapidly becoming accepted in clinical practice. Its use should still be limited to a point in the treatment pathway where otherwise only very major surgical interventions with high morbidity are available. There is an urgent need for further data on this treatment modality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2010 AEU References</strong><br />1.

    "description": "<p>This title has been extracted from the Royal College of Midwives practice guideline <strong>Evidence-based guidelines for midwifery-led care in labour</strong> published in May 2008. \n</p><p>The Birth Environment chapter reviews the importance of the environment in which a woman labours and the effect this has on her overall birth experience.</p>\n<p>Birth Environment Practice Points (taken directly from the guideline):</p>\n<ul><li>The environment in which a woman labours can have a great effect on the amount of fear and anxiety she experiences. Hospital is an alienating environment for most women, in which institutionalised routines and lack of privacy can contribute to feelings of loss of control (Lock and Gibb 2003; Steele 1995). Brown and Lumley (1994) found that the technology and intervention that has now become commonplace on many labour wards was implicated in women’s dissatisfaction with labour. Increased anxiety brought on through loss of control can interfere with the normal effective physiology of labour (Steele 1995). The studies by Green et al. (1990) and Simkin (1992) found that control, or lack of it, was important to the women’s experience of labour and their subsequent emotional wellbeing. \n</li><li>Respect for a woman’s wishes, and her involvement in decision-making is essential, to her care in pregnancy and labour (DH 2004). It would appear that women have better physical and emotional labour outcomes when they are involved in the decision making (Hodnett et al 2005). Green et al.’s study (1990) found that good information was important to a woman’s birth experience and also to her subsequent emotional well-being. The decision-making must extend to the woman’s choice of companion(s), who should be made to feel welcome in the labour ward. \n</li><li>Birth planning is a continuous part of antenatal care. This requires a good discussion about place of birth, at which ‘women should receive clear, unbiased advice and be able to choose where they would like their baby to be born’ (DH 2004). There is no evidence to suggest that it is inadvisable for women without complications to book for delivery at home or in a GP or midwifery unit (MIDIRS 2005). The birth plan should be discussed in full with the midwife looking after the woman in labour. Women often find it difficult to ask questions, so midwives need to encourage them to do so, and to act as advocate for the wishes expressed (Kirkham 1986). \n</li><li>Trials have demonstrated the benefits to women of less intervention and more mobility, in having a low-risk, midwife-led area as an alternative to the traditional labour ward (Byrne 2000; Waldenstrom 1997; Hundley et al. 1994; McVicar et al. 1993). The philosophy behind the provision of such units is to provide a ‘homely’ environment where women can take more control. Labour in these units is managed with minimal intervention (Hundley et al. 1994). It has also been found that women who give birth in low-tech, midwife-led facilities, e.g. home or birth centres, require less pharmacological analgesia (Chamberlain et al. 1997; Skibsted and Lange 1992). Hodnett et al’s (2005) review found that the home-like environment is associated with lower rates of analgesia, augmentation and operative delivery, as well as greater satisfaction with care. There was a non-statistically-significant trend towards higher perinatal mortality in the home-like setting, and the reviewers conclude that ‘an over-emphasis on normality may lead to delayed recognition of or action regarding complications. \n</li><li>Walsh (2004) has challenged this conclusion from his own experience and suggests that midwives who work in this environment are ‘astute assessors of normal birth’ and highly skilled practitioners who are active in doing repeated emergency drills. \n</li><li>From one small trial undertaken in Canada, there are suggestions that women in early labour are best assessed away from the delivery unit, as this results in fewer interventions during the active phase of labour and improves women’s evaluations of their labour and birth experiences (McNiven et al. 1998). Work to test this finding further is in progress in the UK.</li></ul><p></p> ",

Traditional practices such as flexion and extension of the head have been challenged (Myrfield et al. 1997).  <br /><br /></li><li>Two methods of management of the perineum: \"hands on\" and \"hands poised\" have been compared (McCandlish et al. 1998). The only significant difference in outcome was more mild pain at ten days in the \"hands poised\" group. Mayerhofer et al. (2002) confirmed McCandlish et al.'s findings of no statistical difference in overall perineal injury between the two groups but reported an increased rate of episiotomy and third degree tears in the \"hands on\" group. The findings of this study suggest that the \"hands poised\" method can effectively preserve the perineum. The use of either should therefore reflect both the midwife's skill and the informed choice of the woman.<br /><br /></li><li>There is no evidence of short-term or long-term maternal benefit to support the use of liberal episiotomy (Carroli and Belizan 2004). Like any surgical procedure, episiotomy carries a number of risks (Enkin et al. 2000). Women report increased pain and discomfort after episiotomy that interferes with the experience of early motherhood (Kitzinger and Walters 1981). The practice should therefore be restricted mainly to fetal indications (Sleep 1990). <br /><br /></li><li>Episiotomy is strongly associated with a higher frequency of serious trauma (third and fourth degree lacerations) (Eason et al. 2000; Renfrew et al. 1998; Albers et al. 1999). </li></ul><h3>.</h3>",

If this discussion has not taken place by the time that woman goes into labour, it should form part of the initial birth planning. \n</li><li>Intermittent auscultation with a hand held instrument is the recommended method for the woman who is healthy and has had an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy (NICE 2007). \n</li><li>If the auscultated fetal heart rate gives reason for concern, or if any intrapartum risk factors develop, then a continuous record should be obtained using electronic fetal monitoring. \n</li><li>The maternal pulse should be counted if an FHR abnormality is detected to differentiate the two heart rates (NICE 2007). \n</li><li>EFM should not be offered to women in normal labour as it leads to an increase in operative delivery and no improvement in outcomes (NICE 2007; MIDIRS 2005). \n</li><li>EFM should never be offered as a substitute for, or interfere with, continuous care and support during labour (MIDIRS 2005). \n</li><li>Current evidence does not support the use of the admission CTG in low risk pregnancy (NICE 2007; Blix et al. 2003; Impey et al. 2003; Mires et al. 2001;). It should not be used routinely until such time as reliable research has shown it to be of benefit (MIDIRS 2005).</li></ul><p></p> ",

There is no evidence of adverse effects of Leboyer- style deliveries: dimmed lights, soft voices, gentle handling, lack of activity (Leboyer 1975). \n</li><li>Babies can lose heat quite dramatically after birth (Resuscitation Council 2006, Enkin et al. 2000). They should be placed in contact with the mother’s skin and dried with pre-warmed towels (Moore et al 2007, Fardig 1980, Christensson et al. 1992). \n</li><li>Early mother-baby contact should be encouraged as soon as preferred by the mother (Moore et al 2007, Enkin et al. 2000). \n</li><li>Early close contact has positive effects on the inititation and duration of breastfeeding (Colson et al 2008, Moore et al 2007, Anderson et al. 2004; Perez-Escamilla et al. 1994). \n</li><li>Routine delivery ward practice should not be allowed to interfere with the interaction between the mother and her baby and the initiation of breastfeeding (Demott et al 2006) \n</li><li>Any assessment or examination at birth or later should be seen as an opportunity for parental education or health promotion (Demott et al. 2006, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland 2004). \n</li><li>Adminictration of Vitamin K requires informed consent, as well as explanations and education regarding Vitamin K deficiency bleeding and its symptoms (Demott 2006, MIDIRS 2005).</li></ul><p></p> ",

A mistaken diagnosis can lead to a subsequent diagnosis of labour dystocia and a consequent cascade of interventions. \n</li><li>A long latent phase can oftern be a discouraging and exhausting experience (Simkin and Ancheta 2000), and women clearly need good consistent psychological support. \n</li><li>Communication, reassurance and education are vital, and anxiety needs to be alleviated before any other techniques of relaxation can become effective (Austin and Calderon 1999). \n</li><li>Women should be encouraged to maintain normal everyday activity. \n</li><li>Immersion in water in early labour may temporarily halt contractions and give the woman some rest. This may be a disadvantage. Showering in warm water has been suffested as an alternative (Austin and Calderon 1999). \n</li><li>Labour wards may not be the appropriate environment for women in the latent phase (Bailit et al. 2005; Klein et al 2004; Holmes et al. 2001; McNiven 1998).</li></ul>",

This adds important information to our growing knowledge of the effects of different types of HRT and underline the need for caution in long term use. This new data on endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) is unlikely to change the overall balance of risks and benefits for the short term use of HRT. </p>\n<p>Different types of HRT show differing effects on the risk of cancer of the breast and endometrium and both of these need to be considered when deciding the most suitable form of therapy for an individual woman. Each decision to start or continue HRT should be made on an individual basis with a fully informed patient and should take into account any changes in her risk factors and personal preferences. </p>\n<p>The CSM has today repeated their advice that: </p>\n<ol><p>\n</p><li>For the treatment of menopausal symptoms the benefits of short-term HRT are considered to outweigh the risks in the majority of women. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</li><li>In all cases, it is good practice to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time and to review the need to continue treatment at least annually. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</li><li>For postmenopausal women over 50 years who are at an increased risk of bone fracture, HRT should be used to prevent osteoporosis only in those who are intolerant of, or contraindicated for, other osteoporosis therapies. \n<p></p></li></ol><p> The CSM’s Expert Working Group on HRT has kept the safety of HRT under continuous review and will give detailed consideration to this new data next week.

Denial of food can be seen as authoritarian and intimidating, and increase feelings of apprehension (Simkin 1986). <br /><br /></li><li>The majority of sources agree that mild maternal ketosis is a physiological part of normal labour and might even be beneficial (Sommer et al. 2000; Anderson 1998; Keppler 1988). <br /><br /></li><li>Narcotics appear to be the major factor in delaying stomach emptying (Holdsworth 1978; Nimmo et al. 1975). If these are used, then women should stop eating, and drinking be reduced to sips of water.<br /><br /></li><li>While there are no risk factors suggesting the need for general anaesthesia, women who wish to eat and drink in labour should be offered a light, nutritious and easily absorbable diet (Grant 1990).<br /><br /></li><li>The desire to eat, however, would appear to be most common in early labour. As women do not usually wish to eat in active labour, and it is inappropriate to be encouraging them to do so against their natual instincts (Odent 1994).</li></ul><h3>To access this RCM practice guidance, please select the link above, download the document and scroll to page 63 of the guideline.</h3>",

If women have not had access to good information antenatally, the midwife must take responsbility for offering it in labour. \n</li><li>Women should be informed that pethidine, diamorphine and other opioids will provide limited pain relief during labour and may have significant side effects for herself (drowsiness, nausea and vomiting) and her baby (short term respiratory depression and drowsiness) (NICE 2007) \n</li><li>Nitrous oxide seems to relieve some pain but can make women feel nauseous and light headed. There is no evidence of harm to the baby (NICE 2007) \n</li><li>Epidural analgesia is a commonly-used method of pain relief in labour in the UK. For many women it is the most effective, though for some women total relief from pain is not achieved (MIDIRS 2005). There are, however, a number of possible unwanted consequences and side-effects (Tracy et al 2007; NICE 2007; Anin-Somuah et al 2005; Lieberman and O’Donoghue 2002; Leighton and Halpern 2002; Thorp and Breedlove 1996). Women should be counselled about these risks before labour begins. \n</li><li>Epidural analgesia is associated with a longer second stage of labour, an increased incidence of fetal malposition, an increased use of oxytocin and instrumental delivery (Tracy et al 2007; Leiberman et al 2005; Anin-Somuah et al 2005; MIDIRS 2005). Other associated risks are intrapartum fever and retention of urine (Anin-Somuah et al 2005; Lieberman et al. 2000). </li></ul><p></p> ",

    "description": "<p>This title has been extracted from the Royal College of Midwives practice guideline <strong>Evidence-based guidelines for midwifery-led care in labour</strong> published in May 2008. \n</p><p>The Positions for Labour and Birth chapter discusses the effectiveness of the different positions that can be adopted during labour and birth.</p>\n<p>Positions for Labour and Birth Practice Points (taken directly from the guideline):</p>\n<ul><li>There are significant advantage to assuming an upright position in labour and birth (MIDIRS 2005). However, lying down continues to remain common. \n</li><li>Women often \"‘choose\" to do what is expected of them, and the most common image of the labouring woman is \"on the bed\". Midwives therefore need to be proactive in demonstrating and encouraging different positions in labour. \n</li><li>No harmful effects have been associated with walking during labour, and women should be encouraged to do this if they wish (Bloom et al. 1998). \n</li><li>The environment is key to freedom of movement. There should be a variety of furniture and props available in the room that encourage women to try different positions (Albers 2007) \n</li><li>The use of electronic fetal monitoring, intravenous infusions and different methods of analgesia may affect a woman’s mobility and use of postural change during labour (Spiby et al. 2003). Women need to be aware of this in order for them to make an informed choice about their use (MIDIRS 2005). \n</li><li>Use of postural coping strategies during the first stage of labour is associated with providing some pain relief and helping a woman to cope with pain (Simkin and Bolding 2004; Spiby et al. 2003). \n</li><li>Use of upright positions for the second stage of labour confers several benefits including a shorter second stage, fewer instrumental births, fewer episiotomies although estimated blood loss is greater (De Jonge et al 2004; Gupta et al 2004). \n</li><li>Use of the lateral position for birth appears to protect the perineum (Shorten et al. 2002) whereas squatting using a birthing chair has been reported as a predisposing factor for third and fourth degree tears (Jander and Lyrenas 2001). \n</li><li>Women should be encouraged and helped to move and adopt whatever positions they find most comfortable throughout labour (NICE 2007).</li></ul><p></p> ",

Any intervention that interferes with a woman’s ability to cope in labour can have long-term implications for her own well-being and her relationship with her baby (Robson and Kumar 1980; Oakley 1979). \n</li><li>Smyth et al (2007) conclude that amniotomy is not an effective method of shortening spontaneous labour and increases the risk of caesaran section and more fetal heart abnormalities \n</li><li>When there is concern that labour is slowing down, benign measures to intensify contractions such as positional changes and movement may prevent the need for more invasive interventions Simkin and Ancheta (2000) \n</li><li>The decision to rupture membranes should only be taken in direct consultation with the woman, when the evidence is discussed and the intervention is not minimised.

(1)Passive second stage: the finding of full dilatation of the cervix prior to or in the absence of involuntary expulsive contractions. (2) Onset of active second stage: the baby is visible, expulsive contractions with a finding of full dilatation of the cervix or other signs of full dilatation \n</li><li>The mother can exhibit many signals indicating the transition into the active phase of the second stage of labour: change in facial expressions , words, and actions (Enkin et al. 2000; McKay et al. 1990; Bergstrom et al. 1992). However, if the progress of labour gives reason to believe that the cervix is not fully dilated, a vaginal examination should be carried out (Enkin et al. 2000). \n</li><li>Limited quality of evidence makes it difficult to assess the significance of a prolonged second stage (NICE 2007; Altman and Lydon-Rochelle 2006). There is little ground for intervention while maternal and fetal conditions are satisfactory and there is clear progress with the descent of the presenting part, (Janni et al. 2002; Menticoglou et al. 1995; Watson 1994; Paterson et al. 1992). There is however an association between maternal morbidity and a second stage of longer than two hours (Cheng et al's 2004; Myles and Santolaya 2003; Janni et al. 2002; Saunders et al. 1992). . \n</li><li>There is no evidence to suggest that women need to be taught when and how to push (NICE 2007; Bloom et al 2005); Sleep 1990). The practice of sustained breath holding in directed pushing may be harmful (Roberts 2002; Thomson 1993). Women should therefore be given confidence in following their own urge to push. \n</li><li>The \"no noise\"’ rule sometimes invoked in hospital is helpful neither to labouring women, nor to their carers: \"a woman’s sounds in labour should be expected, supported and explained\" (McKay and Roberts 1990). \n</li><li>The recumbent position tends to lengthen labour, to reduce the incidence of spontaneous birth and to increase the incidence of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (NICE 2007; Enkin et al. 2000). Women should be encouraged to combine spontaneous pushing with upright postures.</li></ul><p></p> ",

The effectiveness of these suturing methods and of non-suturing the perineum are discussed.</p>\n<p>Suturing the Perineum Practice Points (taken directly from the guideline):</p>\n<ul><li>A large prospective study of women’s experience of childbirth found that suturing is a major and sometimes traumatic event for women; 12% of the women reported it as the worst thing about giving birth (Green et al. 1998). \n</li><li>The amount of pain experienced during perineal suturing is considerable amongst women who have not received regional analgesia (Sanders et al. 2002). \n</li><li>The severity of the trauma, skill of the operator, technique of repair and type of suture used for repair can all contribute to the levels of perineal pain (Kettle &amp; O’Brien, 2004). \n</li><li>It is important that suturing be carried out without unreasonable delay after the birth, with adequate pain relief (Green et al. 1998). \n</li><li>There is evidence that women prefer to be sutured by midwives; it can mean a reduction in waiting time (Ho 1985) and a more sympathetic approach (Hulme and Greenshields 1993). \n</li><li>The continuous suturing technique for perineal repair when compared to interrupted sutures is associated with less short term pain (Kettle et al, 2007). \n</li><li>Absorbable suture material appears better for women compared to non-absorbable material such as catgut (Kettle and Johanson 2004). \n</li><li>Comparisons of two forms of polyglactin reflect better outcomes for women when the rapidly absorbed material is used (Kettle et al. 2002). \n</li><li>The Ipswich Childbirth Study compared two- and three-stage perineal repairs (Gordon et al. 1998). Women in the two-stage repair group (leaving the skin unsutured) had less pain and dyspareunia at three months postpartum; there were no apparent disadvantages. These advantages persist one year after childbirth (Grant et al. 2001). \n</li><li>Studies of non-suturing of the perineum have conflicting findings in respect of impact on perineal healing (Lundquist et al. 2000; Fleming et al. 2003). Further studies are required. \n</li><li>Administering NSAIDs as rectal suppositories has been found to offer pain relief after perineal trauma and suturing when compared with placebo (Hedayati et al. 2004). \n</li><li>Women have reported a preference for using a specially designed cooling gel pad when compared with ice packs or no treatment. (Steen and Marchant, 2007). Ice packs provide some pain relief 24 to 72 hours after birth when compared to no treatment but no differences in pain levels were detected between cooling and non cooling treatments. No adverse effects on healing have been reported when localised cooling is applied (East et al, 2007). \n</li><li>\n</li><li>Any changes in practice related to perineal care should be accompanied by appropriate education and training for midwives. \n</li><li>It has been estimated that 85% of women experience perineal/ lower genital tract trauma related to childbirth, and that 69% require suturing of that trauma (Kettle et al. 2002). There is some evidence that maternal position during birth can contribute to perineal outcome and an all-fours position is associated with less need for suturing (Soong &amp; Barnes (2005). \n</li><li>The severity of the trauma, skill of the operator, technique of repair and type of suture used for repair can all contribute to the levels of perineal pain (Kettle &amp; O’Brien, 2004). In addition, risk factors such as a long 2nd stage, instrumental deliveries and more severe the trauma is associated with an increase risk of perineal repair breakdown (Williams &amp; Chames 2006).</li></ul><p></p> ",

The temperature of the water should not be above 37.5° C. (<u>NICE 2007</u>)</p>\n</li><li>Women's experiences of water for labour and birth are generally positive in terms of feeling relaxed, involvement in decision-making and feeling more in control (Richmond 2003; Hall and Holloway 1998). <br /><br /></li><li>Effects on women's experience of pain and use of pharmacological methods of pain relief reflect less use of epidural/spinal for pain relief during labour and less reported pain (Cluett et al. 2004). <br /><br /></li><li>Water immersion during labour is associated with no difference in labour duration, type of birth, five minute Apgar Scores, neonatal infection and admission to neonatal units (Cluett et al. 2004). <br /><br /></li><li>For women experiencing dystocia, immersion in water has been found to reduce subsequent epidural use and augmentation and intravenous infusion (Cluett et al. 2004).<br /></li><li>One trial of early immersion (before 5cm dilatation) has been associated with prolongation of labour and increased need for epidural and syntocinon (Eriksson et al. 1997).<br /></li><li>Where women have experienced over 24 hours with spontaneous rupture of membranes, Apgar scores of less than 8 at five minutes are found more commonly amongst babies of women who used water during labour (Waldenstrom and Nilsson 1992).<br /></li><li>Two national surveys of neonatal morbidity and mortality suggested that there was no evidence that this method of care cannot be made available to women (Gilbert and Tookey 1999; Alderdice et al. 1995).<br /></li><li>Midwives should be alert to the possibility of snapping of the umbilical cord when water is used for birth (Crow and Preston 2002).<br /></li><li>Midwives should have access to training in the use of water for labour and birth, and protocols should be in place to support practice (Royal College of Midwives 2000). \n</li><li>Women should be infomed that there is insufficient evidence to either support or discourage giving birth in water (<u>NICE 2007</u>).</li></ul>",

When physiological management is offered to women as a reasonable option, many will choose it (Rogers and Wood 1999). Physiological management can be seen as the logical ending to a normal physiological labour (RCM 1997). \n</li><li>If physiological management is attempted but intervention is subsequently required, then management must proceed actively. If the placenta is retained after one hour, active management should be considered (NICE 2007, Pendeville et al.1988) \n</li><li>Active management is superior to physiological in terms of blood loss (Prendiville et al. 2004; Rogers et al. 1998). The potential adverse effects of active management are nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension (Prendiville et al. 2004). </li></ul><p></p> ",

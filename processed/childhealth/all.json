In general, compared with a regimen of ciclosporin, azathioprine and steroid, the newer immunosuppressive agents consistently reduced the incidence of short-term biopsy-proven acute rejection. However, evidence of the impact on side-effects, long-term graft loss, compliance and overall health-related quality of life is limited. Cost-effectiveness was estimated based on the relationship between short-term acute rejection levels from RCTs and long-term graft loss. Both the addition of daclizumab and that of basiliximab were found to be dominant strategies, that is, regarding cost savings and increased QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin was highly sensitive to key model parameter values and therefore may well be a cost-effective strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of MMF compared with azathioprine, although also sensitive to model parameter, was unattractive.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Link to the full <a href=\"http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ1049.htm\">executive summary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon1049.pdf\">full monograph</a>.</strong></strong></p>",

A large number of markers have been studied in the literature but the majority of studies are so poorly designed and reported that strong clinical conclusions cannot be made from this systematic review. However, we did manage to identify markers that showed possible prognostic importance.<br /></li><li>For ESFT, the following were found to be potentially important prognostic tools and associated with a worse outcome: high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase, lack of S-100 protein expression in the tumour, and lack of expression of the EWS–FLI type 1 fusion transcript in the tumour.<br /></li><li>For neuroblastomas, the following were found to be potentially important tools and associated with a worse outcome: amplification of the <em>MYC-N</em> gene; expression of diploid cells (a DNA index of 1) in the tumour; high expression of neurone-specific enolase in the tumour at diagnosis; high serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and/or ferritin; high multidrug resistance gene-product expression in the tumour; gain of chromosome 17q; deletion of chromosome 1p; low tumour expression of CD44 and/or TrkA; and a low urinary VMA:HVA ratio.<br /></li><li>Clinical interpretation of the above findings is very difficult because of poor and heterogeneous reporting in the literature identified. The benefits of using these prognostic markers in practice needs to be properly studied in large, multicentre studies.<br /></li><li>The current rapid development of genetic epidemiology may quickly provide new genetic markers and genetic sequences that supersede many of the markers we have identified as important.</li></ul><h3>Implications for those conducting and reporting primary studies</h3>\n<ul><li>Reporting of results needs to be improved. Results of all the marker analyses should be presented – both significant and non-significant results – further details are described in the main report. In particular, individual patient data should be made available, including exact initial marker level, method of measurement, time of disease recurrence, follow-up time, final disease status and treatment received for all tumour markers considered.<br /></li><li>A move toward evidence-based use of tumour markers is needed. Investigation of potentially new and clinically better markers should not be at the expense of establishing how existing markers can be most effectively used in practice. For this, collaboration of research groups is required to assess clinical application of markers in studies with much greater patient numbers and to achieve consistency in reporting, for example for cut-off level, outcome assessed (OS or DFS), and adjustment factors.<br /></li><li>Central repositories for IPD required. To help collate and manage IPD, central repositories are necessary for each disease area.<br /></li><li>Future genetic studies to follow our guidelines of reporting and facilitate access to IPD. With the growth in genetic epidemiology potentially leading to identification of genetic markers that could supersede the important markers currently in use, it is very important that those studies are reported properly and make available IPD. Again, central repositories are required to collate and manage such IPD.<br /></li><li>Large, multicentre well-controlled studies are required to assess levels of multiple markers.<br /></li><li>Economic and psychosocial evaluation of markers is required. Once a marker has been identified as clinically effective, the decision to use the marker in practice (e.g. for screening or monitoring) also involves the cost of its implementation and the psychological impact it has on patients. Hence, economic and psychosocial evaluations are necessary. </li></ul><h3>Implications for meta-analysts</h3>\n<ul><li>Sensitivity and multifactorial analyses are needed to explore and adjust for effects of different cut-offs, stages of disease, outcomes (OS or DFS), ages and adjustment factors.<br /></li><li>Results from IPD (the ‘gold standard’ in the reporting of data) need to be compared with those from indirect methods to assess the reliability, validity and bias of use of the latter.</li></ul><h3>Implications for those conducting future systematic reviews</h3>\n<ul><li>Those considering future systematic reviews of tumour markers should seek to obtain individual patient data, as this is likely to be the most productive approach.</li></ul></li>",

QCT could be used where equipment is available as it offers the advantage of measuring volumetric density. Other outcome measures may also be useful but further data are needed to establish their role.</p>\n<h3>Systematic review of effectiveness of bisphosphonate and calcium and/or vitamin D</h3>\n<p>Bisphosphonates are a promising treatment for osteoporosis in children with JIA, but the quality of the current evidence is poor. Better studies are needed to assess more clearly their role and permit licensing of these agents for treatment of children. In particular, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment into adulthood. The accurate assessment of outcome is crucial.</p>\n<p>There are still uncertainties about the use of bisphosphonates in children, including whether the positive effects of treatment continue over time, the length of treatment and the maximal bone mass gain that can be achieved. In particular, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment into adulthood.</p>\n<h3>Long-term bone health in JIA</h3>\n<p>Adults with JIA may have persistent low BMD compared with an otherwise healthy population together with an increased risk of fracture.</p>\n<h3>Systematic review of costs for managing children with JIA and low BMD or fragility fractures</h3>\n<p>There are no studies evaluating the costs of treating children with JIA and low BMD and/or fragility fractures. There are few data evaluating the costs of treating JIA in general.</p>\n<h3>Assessment of cost of treatment for JIA</h3>\n<p>In the first 12 months after diagnosis, children with all JIA disease subtypes consume large, but highly variable, quantities of health service resources. The largest component of health provider costs was consultant rheumatology appointments.</p>\n<p>The right-skewed distribution of costs suggests that a few high cost outliers increased the mean costs for the group overall, and within individual disease subgroups. Data from a larger cohort, over a longer period, are required to substantiate these results further.</p>\n<h3>Implications for healthcare</h3>\n<p>All methods of assessing outcome have limitations; DXA is the current most practical measure but results in children must be interpreted with care. Fractures would be the ideal outcome measure but a study with this end-point would require large numbers of patients and long-term follow up. However, fracture data could be routinely collected for local and other registers. Bisphosphonates seem to be effective in the management of children with JIA but the evidence is limited. Few children with JIA have been treated with bisphosphonates; the studies include case series and case reports and there are no true controlled studies, the studies are heterogeneic in design (different subtypes of JIA are included in different studies, children with other connective tissue disease also included, different bisphosphonates and varied doses and routes of administration are used and durations of treatment and follow-up times vary), together with poor assessment of outcome measures and varied methods of reporting results. There are still many unanswered questions about bisphosphonates' use, including the optimum dose and frequency of administration and length of treatment. The maximal BMD gain that can be achieved is not known. It is not clear whether the positive effects of treatment continue over time. There is limited evidence on the use of calcium and/or vitamin D. Assessment of outcome was poor in all studies. The problems of poor bone health persist into adulthood; adults with JIA have an increased numbers of fractures compared with expected values in otherwise healthy adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Links to the full executive summary :<br /></strong><a href=\"http://www.hta.nhs.uk/execsumm/summ1203.shtml\">http://www.hta.nhs.uk/execsumm/summ1203.shtml</a></p>",

The programme is located within the larger context of the recent Public Health White Paper, <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550\">Choosing Health</a> (Department of Health, 2004), which emphasises the significance of individual choice in determining a wide range of health and social behaviours, and the potential of incentives to aid behaviour change. If tangible incentives are effective in helping young people to develop and maintain healthy and prosocial behaviours, this is of importance to the formulation of health promotion policies.</p>\n<p>Two broad research questions drove this systematic review and provided the conceptual basis for a systematic map of relevant research in the area. The first question was about effectiveness:</p>\n<ul><li>What is the best available evidence of the effectiveness or otherwise of incentive schemes to improve health and other social behaviours in young people aged 11–19?</li></ul><p>The second question focused on processes:</p>\n<ul><li>In what conditions are incentive schemes more or less effective?</li></ul><p>For example:<br />• In which areas (e.g. health, education) do they work best?<br />• For which groups of young people do incentive schemes work best (e.g. at-risk young people)?<br />• Are universal or targeted approaches more effective?</p>",

It wants to do this in a partnership with active, responsible parents and empowered communities, supported by public services that deliver packages of support tailored to families’ needs.</p>\n<p>To support parents to meet their responsibilities in raising their children and to help strengthen the role of communities in supporting parents, the Government has made tackling child poverty a priority since 1997, has created a network of Sure Start Children’s Centres to support children and families in the vital early years and has invested record sums in schools to help raise attainment.</p>\n<p>The Government wants to ensure that the primary role of public services is to support families and communities to improve children’s outcomes. The Government’s change programme for children’s services, Every Child Matters, has established a strong foundation for a new, integrated way of delivering support to children and families and the communities in which they live. Every Child Matters sets out that every child, whatever their background or their circumstances, should have the support they need to achieve five key outcomes:</p>\n<p>• be healthy;<br />• stay safe;<br />• enjoy and achieve;<br />• make a positive contribution; and<br />• achieve economic well-being.</p>\n<p>Children’s Trusts are bringing together services for children, particularly local education services, children’s social services and health services, by ensuring that planning and delivery is coordinated and information is shared so that children are supported before they reach crisis point.</p>\n<p>In the future the UK must respond to new challenges that will impact upon children and families: demographic and socio-economic change; technological developments and increasing global competition. To continue to support parents and families and ensure that public services contribute as effectively as possible to improved outcomes for all children, young people and families in ways that meet their needs, the Government will, over this Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) period (2008-09 to 2010-11), take action in a number of key areas.</p>",

This reflects a growing recognition of the importance of the early years of life in determining adult health and in preventing a range of adverse child health outcomes that may be associated with social disadvantage. These include outcomes such as child accidents and injuries (which display a steep social gradient in the UK), and child abuse and maltreatment. However, the emphasis in many home-visiting programmes has also been to promote positive aspects of ‘family wellness’, including the cognitive and intellectual development of children, parenting skills and support, positive maternal mental health and use of other health services. \n</p><p>This evidence briefing is a review of reviews about the effectiveness of ante- and post-natal home-visiting programmes for improving child and maternal outcomes. Specifically, this briefing aims to: \n</p><p>• Identify all relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses and other reviews<br />• Review the evidence provided in these papers<br />• Highlight conflicting evidence, gaps in the evidence and make recommendations about future research and commissioning.<br /></p>",

    "description": "<p>Recommendations from the report:</p>\n<ul><li>Exclusive breastfeeding to the age of six months with continued breastfeeding as part of a progressively varied diet is recommended for all infants. WHO Growth Standards describe the growth of infants in good health who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months. They are applicable to all infants, whether breast or formula-fed. The new standards may help to establish exclusive breastfeeding as the norm in the first half of infancy. \n</li><li>When compared to the UK1990 reference WHO Growth Standards depict a pattern of slower weight gain between 4 to 24 months and should be preferred to UK1990 references during this period. Current evidence suggests that such a pattern of growth could potentially reduce the risk of later obesity. \n</li><li>WHO Growth Standards represent a pattern of linear growth, which is remarkably consistent between different countries and ethnic groups following recommended feeding practices. They are applicable to all children in the UK, including those from ethnic minority groups. \n</li><li>The UK1990 Growth References should be used in line with current practice for monitoring the growth of preterm infants and children over the age of 24 months. \n</li><li>The Committee specifically recommend adopting the new WHO Growth Standards from 2 weeks to take account of the differences in birthweight, gestational age and the adjustment in weight that often occurs in the first two weeks after birth. \n</li><li>The optimum age at which the transition between WHO and UK1990 references might be made cannot be stated on scientific grounds. A disjunction must arise in every case at 2 years (because of the transition between supine length and height measurement and, to a lesser degree, transition from the WHO longitudinal to the cross-sectional data set). Transferring from WHO data to UK1990 data at any age later than 2-years would create two disjunctions, rather than one on the BMI chart and this may be undesirable. Transferring as late as 5-years could impact on school-entry national surveillance programmes. \n</li><li>The feasibility of using WHO Growth Standards from 2-weeks of postnatal age to 24 months and UK1990 from 24 months onwards requires piloting and field-testing before being formally adopted. \n</li><li>Health professionals involved in child health are likely to require additional training and guidance on the use and interpretation of WHO Growth Standards and UK1990 references for monitoring growth in clinical practice. Adequate training for health professionals should include clear guidance on the monitoring of infants in the first two weeks after birth. \n</li><li>Adoption and implementation of the charts should be preceded by a well-planned communications strategy and should include the use of standardized training and information materials to ensure that parents and carers receive clear and consistent advice. </li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>A joint report published by the Audit Commission and the Healthcare Commission.</p>\n<p>Better Safe Than Sorry: Preventing Unintentional Injury to Children, says that each year there are approximately two million attendances by children at hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments as the result of accidents that might have been prevented.</p>\n<p>This costs the NHS approximately £146 million per year and the most recent figures show that accidental injuries kill three children in every 100,000 each year – a similar rate to cancer.</p>\n<p>Injuries such as those caused by burns, falling down stairs at home, slipping on railway embankments and poisoning, are a leading cause of death and illness in children aged 1-14, and account for approximately 120,000 admissions to hospital a year. </p>\n<p>However, understanding of the underlying causes of children’s injury is patchy and the actual number of injuries each year is unknown.</p>\n<p>Although the overall number of deaths has fallen, the report shows that there are persistent and widening differences between socio-economic groups. Children of parents who have never worked, or who have been unemployed for a long time, are 13 times more likely to die from unintentional injury than children of parents in higher managerial and professional occupations.</p>\n<p>There are many ad hoc local initiatives to help prevent children’s accidents, but they are often poorly coordinated and rely on committed individuals who frequently work in isolation and sometimes duplicate what others have done. There is also an absence of evaluative data on the success of local prevention initiatives.</p>\n<p>However, there were notable exceptions. In Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale, strong relationships between the primary care trust’s accident prevention team and the A&amp;E department resulted in targeted campaigns on reducing accidents and reduced hospital attendances for the under-fives. Measures included free installation of safety equipment in areas of deprivation and the overall estimated saving to the local economy was £1.9 million.</p>\n<p>The report recommends that:</p>\n<ul><li>the Department of Health and other central departments of government should together state more clearly what is required locally to prevent accidents and give more information on what works;<br /></li><li>councils, primary care trusts and their partners need to know how and where accidents occur by pooling their information; and<br /></li><li>together, councils, primary care trusts and their partners need to apply evidence of what works and evaluate the impact at the local level and sustain their actions.<br /></li></ul><p>The report recommends that central government must support local action better by being clearer about the roles and responsibilities of the various bodies, co-ordinating the work of individual Departments in making the information they have available, and developing a fuller understanding on how to prevent unintentional injury.</p>\n<p>The report sets out how successful prevention requires a more rigorous approach locally, based on the proper assessment of children’s needs, good and well-collated data, agencies working together, a clear strategy and an approach based on evidence of what works. </p>\n<p>There are also recommendations in the report for the NHS primary care trusts, local councils and the Healthcare Commission. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Report published by BLISS. Their findings suggest that most mothers of premature or sick babies do express milk for their newborns, and that many find it a positive and rewarding experience. The challenge for neonatal teams is to ensure that all mothers are properly supported to start expressing as early and often as possible so that they have the best possible chance of fully breastfeeding later on, that they are helped to make the transition to breastfeeding if this is possible, and that they can continue to breastfeed for as long as they wish. This can only be achieved if mothers also have access to relevant equipment and facilities.</p>\n<p>Giving new mothers the support they need to be able to express and breastfeed is time-consuming and requires specialist knowledge. The knowledge and attitudes of the unit staff and other health professionals will determine what information and advice a mother receives, and are therefore crucial to her success. Mothers of premature babies may have missed out on antenatal classes and, as a result, are more in need of this information and support.</p>\n<p>The comments made to BLISS by the women who took part in the survey suggest that nursing staff on the neonatal unit are aware of the importance of encouraging mothers to express. However, it seems that this encouragement is not always accompanied by consistent practical advice, and that the association between early support to express frequently and success with lactation and breastfeeding is not always recognised. By helping a new mother to express immediately after birth, and supporting her frequent expression thereafter, the unit staff make a significant contribution to ensuring the best possible outcome for the baby.</p>\n<p>BLISS conclude that it is essential that mothers receive consistent support from all health professionals across all the UK’s neonatal units, and that the distribution of information is properly planned and implemented.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The reorganisation of neonatal services in England has helped improve care for premature and low birth weight babies with fewer babies travelling long distances for suitable treatment. But, according to the National Audit Office, further improvements to the service are being limited by shortages in nursing staff, a lack of cots in the right place at the right level of care and a lack of widespread specialist 24 hour transport.</p>\n<p>Every year around 10 per cent, or 60,000, newborn babies require some form of specialized neonatal care. And these numbers are increasing, up 5 per cent between 2005 and 2006, due to an increase in the proportion of women with high risk factors such as high or low maternal age, obesity, ethnic origin, deprivation and assisted conception such as IVF. In 2006-07, some £420 million was spent on running the 180 neonatal units in England, which are organized into 23 managed clinical networks.</p>\n<p>This report identified a number of improvements since the Department announced the reorganization of neonatal services into networks in 2003. There has been a reduction in long distance transfers of mothers and babies, with only 3.4 per cent of babies across England admitted to units outside of their network. Overall, 17 networks are meeting the target to treat babies within their network and the consistency, communication and co-ordination of care within and between the networks has improved. The number of cots has also increased from 3,243 to 3,521. Neonatal units have made strides in considering the needs of parents and involving them in their babies care. Parents are mostly very happy with the specialist care and expertise their babies receive.</p>\n<p>In 2005, England’s neonatal mortality rate was 3.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, similar to other developed countries. But the report found that this figure masks wide variations across the country. The South West Midlands had the highest mortality rate of 4.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to Surrey and Sussex with 1.8 deaths per live 1,000 births. More work is required to determine the contribution that different socio-economic, ethnic, demographic, cultural and service factors are making to these variations in mortality rates.</p>\n<p>The report also highlights shortages in the numbers of neonatal nurses. On average, each unit had nearly three nursing vacancies for nurses qualified in neonatal care. Only half of units met the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM) professionally developed standard for high dependency care of one nurse to two babies, and only 24 per cent met the standard for intensive care of one nurse to one baby. The vast majority of level three (intensive care) units, which require a 1:1 ratio of nurses to babies for the whole unit, did not meet the standards for intensive care.</p>\n<p>Cots for the right level of care are not always available, resulting in units having to close and babies being cared for in the wrong places on occasions. On average, each unit had to close to new admissions once a week, the most common reasons being a lack of cots or skilled nursing staff. Nearly a third of units had to care for a baby who should have been transferred to a higher level of care and just over half looked after an improving baby who was ready to be transferred but could not because a receiving cot was not available. In 2006-07, nearly a third of neonatal units operated above the BAPM recommended occupancy rate of 70 per cent and three units operated above 100 per cent. High occupancy rates could have consequences for patient safety, for example due to increased risk of infection or inadequate levels of care.</p>\n<p>Neonatal transport is an essential element of networked neonatal care, with all bar one providing some form of specialist transport during day time working hours, but only half of networks providing specialist transport services 24 hours a day seven days a week. Few transport services have separate staffing arrangements from the clinical inpatient services meaning that staff have to leave the unit to accompany a baby on a transfer. Three quarters of units experienced delays in moving babies and 44 per cent believed that care was compromised as a result.</p>\n<p>The report concludes that the cost of neonatal services as a whole are not fully understood and there is a mismatch between costs and charges. Also charges per day for an intensive care cot varied from £173 to £2,384. The reorganization of care into neonatal networks has improved the co-ordination and consistency of services pointing to increased effectiveness, however there is still capacity and staffing problems and a lack of clear data on outcomes. In addition, the variable financial management information makes it difficult to judge the economy and efficiency of the service. </p>\n<p>The NAO recommends that NHS and Foundation Trusts need to improve their financial management information. Commissioners, in conjunction with networks and Strategic Health Authorities, should commission all neonatal care services together and in particular examine the relative cost-effectiveness of the different transport options currently in place. In addition, NHS and Foundation Trusts should develop a targeted action plan to address neonatal staffing shortages.</p>",

This review was commissioned by the Department of Health (England) to provide practitioners, policy-makers and researchers with a summary of evidence to help them plan interventions for children that are likely to be effective in bringing about sustainable behaviour change, and to identify future research needs.</p>\n<p>The review examines the number, types and quality attributes of existing research studies. It synthesises the findings of a sub-set of these studies to assess what helpsand what stops children eating fruit and vegetables. There are three main syntheses in this review: 1) a statistical meta-analysis of studies which attempt to increase children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables; 2) a thematic qualitative synthesis of studies focused on children’s views of healthy eating; and 3) a ‘cross-study synthesis’ which uses the results of 2) in order to interpret the findings of 1).</p>\n<p>The policy and practice implications of the findings of the review are discussed and recommendations for future interventions, development and research are made.</p>\n<p>There are many useful messages in this work for policy-makers, commissioners, practitioners and researchers who have a remit to promote or conduct research on healthy eating amongst children.

    "description": "<p>This report was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency. The contents of this final technical report represent the views of the researchers and not necessarily those of the Food Standards Agency.</p>\n<p>The study recruited over 130 children in each of the two age groups (3 year olds and 8 to 9 year olds) from schools and nurseries and pre-schools in the Southampton area. From the families who initially volunteered to take part in the study, children were recruited to represent the full range of behaviours from normal through to high level hyperactivity. </p>\n<p>The results showed that in the sample of 3 year old children Mix A showed a significant adverse effect on the average level of hyperactivity within this group, compared with the placebo, but Mix B did not. For the 8-year old children, Mix B but not Mix A showed a significant adverse effect on the average level of hyperactivity compared with the placebo. </p>\n<p>There were marked individual differences between children in their response to the artificial food colour and preservative mixtures with some responding substantially and others not at all. The researchers reported that one factor influencing this variable response to additives was the child’s genetic make-up. For both 3 year old and 8 year old children the researchers found that some specific types of genetic make-up, specifically to do with variations in certain genes involved in the release of histamine from cells, were associated with greater responses to either or both of the test mixtures.</p>\n<p>The researchers consider that the results from this study add to the previous work on the Isle of Wight. The study demonstrates that using an aggregated measure of hyperactivity based on parent ratings, teacher ratings, direct observation of behaviour and, in the case of older children, direct testing of attention, certain mixtures of additives based on artificial colours and benzoate preservative, had adverse effects on the hyperactive behaviour of some children. The significant effects that were observed in this new study were shown in terms of an increase in the mean level of hyperactivity for the group. Not all children show more hyperactive behaviour on the active mix than on the placebo challenge. Importantly this work is based on a representative sample of children selected from the general population; the results are not limited to an extreme group of children showing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. </p>",

This algorithm represents the conclusions of the review in terms of effective practice. There were insufficient data to propose an algorithm for the further investigation of UTI in children under 5; instead, the different imaging options are discussed and areas requiring further research are highlighted.</p>\n<p>The quality assessment highlighted several areas that could be improved upon in future diagnostic accuracy studies.

Renowned Clinical Professor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, David Isaacs, and an expert consultant editor team, bring you the first book to critically look at the evidence for decision making in pediatric infections.; Based around illustrative case studies, each chapter presents and analyzes current evidence on the management of different pediatric infections and provides firm treatment recommendations based on evidence of: efficacy and safety; antibiotic resistance; cost; adverse effects; and ethical considerations.; Clear summaries and specific guidance allow you to assess the evidence for yourself and make rapid but informed management decisions based on the strength of evidence available. Antibiotic doses are presented clearly and simply, enabling you to select appropriate treatment at a glance.; This book uses a case-based approach that focuses on the most common disease areas affecting children in industrialized countries, developing countries, travelers and refugees. It is an up-to-date, relevant and widely applicable text that carefully examines the evidence for antibiotics and other interventions whilst encouraging a conservative and responsible approach to antibiotic use.; \"Evidence-based Pediatric Infectious Diseases\" is an indispensable resource for any practitioner who strives to provide the best evidence-based care for childhood infections.</p>\n<p>ISBN: 9781405148580</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> \n</p><p>NHS Staff wishing to access e-books need a (free) Athens username and password which can be arranged at any local NHS Library or online at <a href=\"https://register.athensams.net/nhs/\">https://register.athensams.net/nhs/</a>.<a href=\"https://register.athensams.net/nhs/\"></a></p>",

Many schools are already providing health 'drop-ins' as part of the extended services they offer, and many more are thinking about joining up with health colleagues to offer them. This guidance seeks to help those setting up new services to learn from the experience of those who are already offering them. <br /> <br />The guidance provides practical advice, case studies and responses to frequently asked questions. It explains how on-site health advice can help free young people from health concerns that affect their ability to learn effectively or, at worst, lead to their disengagement from learning. It also shows how improving young people's access to health advice can help to tackle public health concerns, including sexual health, teenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol misuse, obesity, and emotional health and well-being. ",

The research team from King's College London found that these health professionals have multiple and complex roles in children's health care, which are vital to existing services.\nThe researchers had a nine-month timescale during which they looked at more than 13,000 abstracts from pieces of literature and included 393 for their reviews that targeted 10 topic areas. They analysed the chosen literature, which covered many areas including role details, contribution to services, assessment details, intervention details, results and factors that helped or hindered health professionals. The researchers also held two conferences, one in London and the other in Manchester, at which 113 people attended collectively, including nurses, midwives, health visitors, service users, voluntary organisations, and medical and allied health professionals. After presentations, the delegates were split into different small groups for discussions on the 10 topic areas. The information gathered from the two events was fed into the research team’s overall analysis.",

Formerly, a child's origins were secret and the child had no right of access to its birth records.<br />Current adoption practice addresses the issue with greater openness. Adoption continues to uphold the irreversible transfer of parental rights but adopted people can maintain links with their families and recognition is given to the importance of history and origins. \n</p><p>The primary aim in producing these guidelines was to help those involved in adoption before this openness came about. \n</p><p>The guide covers the legislative framework, the principles underlying services for birth relatives, the practicalities of implementing and delivering services and the dilemmas and issues that need to be considered.<br />Sections within the guidelines contain useful contacts and an appendix provides sample letters. \n</p><p>Please note, this is a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. \n</p><p>The website of the Quality Protects programme:<br /><a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/qualityprotects/\">The Quality Protects Programme</a></p>",

Also to determine the cost-effectiveness of combined hydrotherapy and land-based physiotherapy in JIA.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> \n</p><h3>Implications for healthcare</h3>\n<p>JIA is a disease in which a cure is not available. This research demonstrates a beneficial effect from both combined hydrotherapy and land-based physiotherapy treatment and land-based physiotherapy treatment alone in JIA without any exacerbation of disease, indicating that treatments are safe. </p>\n<p>The caveat to the results of the cost-effectiveness and clinical efficacy analysis is that the restricted sample size could have prevented a true difference being detected between the groups. Nevertheless, there appears to be no evidence to justify the costs of building pools or initiating new services specifically for use in this disease. However, this conclusion may not apply to patients with unremitting active disease who could not be entered into the trial because of specified exclusion criteria. For this group, hydrotherapy or combined treatment may still be the only physiotherapy option.</p>\n<h3>Recommendations for research</h3>\n<ul><li>The following areas are suggested for further research: investigation and development of appropriate and sensitive outcome measures for use in future hydrotherapy and physiotherapy trials of JIA. \n</li><li>Preliminary studies of methodologies in complex interventions such as physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to improve recruitment and ensure protocol is acceptable to patients and carers. \n</li><li>Investigation of hydrotherapy in the most common paediatric user group, children with neurological dysfunction, ensuring appropriate outcome measures are available and methodologies previously tried. \n</li><li>Comparison of patient satisfaction and compliance between land-based physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. \n</li><li>European studies of hydrotherapy in rare disorders such as JIA.</li></ul>",

They are more likely to have been in care, witnessed violence in the home or have been the victim of crime. Many young offenders often have difficulties in gaining access to mainstream health services due to a lack of parental support. </p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>\n<p>The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) weighs and measures children in Reception (typically aged 4–5 years) and Year 6 (aged 10–11 years) annually. The report highlights the usefulness of the NCMP Dataset in furthering our understanding of underweight, overweight and obesity in children, as well as highlighting some areas where improvements can be made in the programme, or where further analysis and investigation is required. The purpose of this report is not to provide specific local results, but an understanding from national-level analysis that can be used to inform local uses and analysis of NCMP data.<br /></p>\n<p>Reported prevalence of obesity and overweight data appear to be influenced by:</p>\n<p><strong>Participation rates:</strong> Low participation rates and high opt out rates,<br />particularly for Year 6, are associated with lower reported prevalence figures for overweight and obesity. This is likely to be caused by a selective opt out of larger children. This factor is likely affect the accuracy of prevalence figures.</p>\n<p>In order to meet the 2007/08 participation goal of 85%, and also to ensure<br />prevalence figures produced using NCMP data reflect the true prevalence in their populations, PCTs may need to improve participation rates, particularly for Year 6. Individual non-participation is a bigger issue than pupils not being measured on a whole school basis.</p>\n<p>If PCTs are able to record non-participation rates in 2007/08 this could<br />support analysis to inform improvements to the programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Rounding of measures:</strong> Accurate measurement and recording of<br />measurements is important. Higher levels of rounding, especially of weight, appear to have a significant impact on PCT level prevalence figures.</p>\n<p>Correct training and a good awareness of NCMP guidance will help staff to<br />ensure correct recording of children’s measurements. It is also important for PCTs to use the appropriate equipment, e.g. properly calibrated, digital<br />scales.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of children measured:</strong> Although obesity prevalence is known to<br />increase with age, there is no evidence from NCMP data of any increase in<br />prevalence between younger and older children within the NCMP age bands. There is however some evidence of an association between children measured at younger ages and higher reported prevalence figures at PCT level for both school years. This may be due to the time of year at which measures are taken. Further analysis is required to investigate if this is indeed an important factor that may need to be considered in future years.</p>\n<p><strong>Sex:</strong> The highest rates of non-participation appear to be among girls in Year 6, and this may result in an overestimation of the differences in prevalence of obesity between boys and girls at national level. There is however little evidence of this factor having an impact on headline PCT prevalence figures where the sexes are combined. Prevalence of obesity in childhood is closely linked to the sociodemographics of the population. The most important factors appear to be:</p>\n<p><strong>Socioeconomic deprivation:</strong> Measures of deprivation can explain up to 60% of the variation in prevalence of obesity between PCTs and are an important predictor of childhood obesity prevalence. The strength of this relationship is such that indices of deprivation could be used as a proxy for obesity prevalence in areas where data quality is poor, or for small populations (e.g. schools) where NCMP data are unable to provide robust data.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> There are substantial differences in prevalence of childhood obesity by ethnic group, especially for Year 6. The highest rates of prevalence are found outside the ‘White British’ ethnic groups. Differences in the ethnic breakdown of PCT populations can explain a significant proportion of the variation in prevalence between PCTs. The association between ethnicity and prevalence of obesity requires further investigation. There is evidence that some ethnic groups with high prevalence have a substantially different height profile from the ‘White British’ population. The 1990 British Growth Reference, as used to classify children as overweight or obese, was based on a sample of ‘White British’ children and the suitability of this reference for today’s multicultural population needs to be examined.</p>\n<p>Analysis of these issues suggests that NCMP data may underestimate the true population prevalence of obesity and overweight at national, regional and local level.</p>",

All the searches were carried out in October 2007.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Sources Searched</strong><br />The following sources were searched by two information specialists: </p>\n<ul><li>Dialog MEDLINE (using SIGN MEDLINE systematic review filter and “Palliative Care” or “Palliative Treatment” as free text search terms, limited to since 2003 and children. </li>\n<li>DIALOG EMBASE (using SIGN EMBASE systematic review filter and “Palliative Care” or “Palliative Treatment” as free text search terms). </li>\n<li>Cochrane Library (using “Palliative Care” and “Palliative Treatment” as free text search terms), hand sifting for reviews relating to children and adolescents. </li>\n<li>PUBMED (using PUBMED Clinical Queries systematic review filter and “Palliative Care” or “Palliative Treatment” as free text search terms) The search was further limited to the last 5 years and by Infant, Child, Newborn, Preschool Child and Adolescent. </li>\n<li>NLH Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library using “Palliative Care” and “Palliative Treatment” as a free text search terms and using results under the “evidence” tab, limited to 2006 onwards by hand sifting. </li>\n<li>PaedPal searched for “systematic review” as a keyword and lmited the search to 2003 onwards, handsifted for articles relating to children. </li></ul><p>Details of the SIGN systematic review filters can be found on the following webpage:<br /><a href=\"http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.html\">http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.html</a></p>\n<p>Details of the PUBMED Clinical Queries systematic review filter and its validation can be found via the following link:<br /><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/clinical.shtml\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/clinical.shtml</a> </p>\n<p><br /><strong>Identification of systematic reviews</strong><br />All citations found in the searches were hand sifted by reading the titles and abstracts to identify systematic reviews and potential systematic reviews relevant to palliative care in children. A particularly careful analysis of the methods was made to identify citations with a systematic review methodology (used the NLH paper ‘Template for conducting an evidence update’, see section on ‘How can I tell if I have a systemic review?’). For all potential systematic reviews where there was still some doubt, the full texts were then read to ensure that they were indeed systematic reviews.  <br /> <br />To determine systematic reviews, the definition of a systematic review from the Glossary of Cochrane Collaboration Terms on the Cochrane Collaboration website was used:<br /> <br />“A review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the included studies.”<br /> <br />A final list of systematic reviews was created by combining the searches and removing duplicates. The search was broken down into the following sub topics for usability: Respiratory, Gastroenterology, Cancer, HIV, Migraine / Headache, Pain, Nursing, ICU, Quality of Life and, Ethics.<br /> <br />The final decisions on whether to include a citation as relevant to the topic and being a systematic review was made at the final editing stage by Dr Mark Everard, Clinical Lead for the NLH Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library.<br /> <br />For Cochrane reviews that have been updated since original publication, only the citation for the most recent version is included in the final list.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Analysis of Search Results</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dialog MEDLINE using SIGN filter: 3<br />Dialog Embase using SIGN filter: 5<br />Cochrane: 44<br />PUBMED clinical query: 20<br />NLH Child Health Specialist Library: 38 <br />PaedPal: 22</p></blockquote>",

    "description": "<p>Since April 2002, all NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England have been expected to establish a Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). PALS have been set up to enable patients and the public to access information and raise issues they are concerned about with their Trust. Together with the development of an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service (ICAS), PALS form part of a new system of user involvement in the NHS introduced by the NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000). </p>\n<p>PALS are intended to serve all, including ‘vulnerable’ and ‘hard to reach sections of the community’ (Department of Health, 2002). In this research we surveyed PALS in NHS Trusts and PCTs in England to examine whether and, if so, how, access to and use of the service was being promoted to children, young people and parents. The survey included some reference to other groups (such as older people and ethnic minorities) in order to explore whether PALS were more or less inclusive of different sections of the community. </p>\n<p>A final sample of 243 PALS based in PCTs (n=122), NHS Trusts (n=101), pan-PCT and NHS Trusts (n=15), and Children’s Hospitals (n=5) was obtained. The key findings were: </p>\n<p>• PALS have so far been developed as a generic service, with some efforts to promote the service to specific sections of the community. </p>\n<p>• Where PALS have focused on potentially hard-to-reach groups, they have tended to concentrate most of all on older people and least of all on children. • Training for PALS staff was more likely to include a focus on people with communication difficulties, ethnic minorities and older people, and least likely to focus on children, young people and parents. </p>\n<p>• Respondents felt more positive about the PALS ability to deal with the concerns of older people and parents than they did children and people with learning difficulties; they were generally confident of the service’s ability to deal with the concerns of users in general. </p>\n<p>• Respondents suggested ways in which the service could be promoted to children, young people and parents. However, some also expressed concern about the adequacy of existing resources to support additional promotional work, meet any increase in demand and deal with the specific needs of particular groups. </p>\n<p>The results of the survey raises issues about how the PALS can be made more inclusive of children and young people as users in their own right, as well as their parents. This will be explored in the latter stages of this study where their perspectives will be sought and used to produce guidelines for Trusts on involving these users. </p>\n<p>The survey also highlights the importance of recording parents' use of PALS on behalf of children and young people, and any indirect use of PALS by children, young people and parents via proxy-PALS staff in Trusts. Finally, the survey has identified concerns about whether existing resources are adequate to target and facilitate the involvement of specific groups such as children, young people and parents. </p>",

This evidence is essential to support a screening programme for a non-fatal condition for which there have been no rigorously controlled trials. An invitation t o preschool visi on screening carries with it the implicit assumption that screening is going to benefit the child. In the absence of sound evidence that the target conditions sought in these programmes are disabling and that the interventions available to correct them do more good than harm, the ethical basis for such interventions is very weak. </p></li>",

    "description": "<p>This study was funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Unit Programme. The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the funders.</p>\n<p>There is a now growing recognition of the need to promote the well-being of children through the adoption of outcomes-focused practices and assessment by social care and other support services. Initially, the Looked after Children (LAC) framework defined seven dimensions on which the progress of children looked after by the local authority should be assessed: health, education, identity, family and social relationships, social presentation, emotional and behavioural development, and self care skills. More recently, the government's Every Child Matters outcomes framework for all children and young people - focusing on the five outcomes of be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and achieve, make a positive contribution and achieve economic well-being - has become central to all policy for children. Similarly, the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services sets standards of good practice for services in promoting the health and well-being of all children, and emphasises the need for services to work together to achieve positive outcomes for children and young people. </p>\n<p>Such policies provide a context within which agencies are expected to deliver services which achieve the best possible outcomes, aiming to ensure that the children and families most at risk of social exclusion have every opportunity to build successful and independent lives. These developments point to the need to look more closely at the situation of disabled children. Clearly, both the LAC and ECM outcomes are valuable and relevant for disabled children. However, interpreting what these outcomes might mean can be difficult when the presence of an impairment or a complex health condition may compromise the achievement of developmental milestones or impact on physical health and functioning. For instance, how do we view 'achievement' for a child with a degenerative condition, or 'being healthy' for a child with a life limiting illness? How can we assess what is appropriate progress for child with an autistic spectrum disorder on 'making a positive contribution'? </p>\n<p>In addition, these frameworks focus only on outcomes for children, rather than the outcomes that parents themselves might require from service provision in order to support their parenting role. For parents with disabled children consideration of the outcomes services should aim to achieve is especially important as research has shown that they provide extra care, over and above that of 'the reasonable parent', and it is with this extra care that they need support. In addition, they are particularly vulnerable to stress, which can be produced by trying to meet the extra demands of caring for the child without the necessary resources and support. Parental stress in turn impinges upon children's development, and has also been identified as a reason for residential placements of disabled children. </p><b>\n<p>Research aims </p>\n<p></p></b>\n<p>This project built on both the above frameworks and earlier SPRU work on outcomes for disabled adults and older people and aimed to: </p>\n<ol>\n<p></p></ol><ul><li>identify desired outcomes of support services from the perspectives of disabled children, young people and their parents; \n</li><li>explore managers’ and practitioners’ perspectives on outcomes; \n</li><li>work with local authority staff, children and parents, to develop ways of collecting outcome information that can be used in practice; \n</li><li>pilot and evaluate the use of outcome assessment in practice. </li></ul><p></p><b>\n<p>Design and methods </p>\n<p></p></b>The project consisted of four stages: \n<ol><p></p></ol><ul><li>Qualitative research, including individual interviews, focus groups and observation, with children and parents about desired outcomes of support services. \n</li><li>Participatory workshops with managers and practitioners to identify professionals’ perspectives on outcomes for disabled children. \n</li><li>Development of systems for collecting data on outcomes within the research sites.  \n</li><li>Pilot implementation of collection of outcomes data and evaluation of that process within the research sites. </li></ul><ol><p></p></ol><p>The project took place within three local authorities, selected to cover different organisational and geographic structures and to ensure inclusion of diverse socio-demographic groups, including ethnic minorities. In consultation with policy makers at DH, it was recognised that outcomes for disabled children are best viewed as a multi-agency collaborative responsibility and a focus on social care alone could restrict the data. Therefore, a further criterion for selection of authorities was existence of multi-agency planning groups willing to collaborate with the research. </p>",

The fact that there is not sufficient evidence to merit the introduction of universal screening does not imply that speech and language delay should not be identified, for example, by less formal methods. </p>",

This process involves appraising the research evidence underpinning guideline recommendations and then circulating the findings to College members. It is hoped that the College’s guideline appraisal programme encourages paediatricians and other health professionals to practice evidence-based medicine and to implement guidelines by incorporating the recommendations into their practice. \n</li><li>To provide a list of useful sources of information available on the internet about guideline development and implementation.</li></ul>",

A number of respondents commented both as individuals and on behalf of their organisation –<br />these have been counted as separate responses.</p>\n<p>Over 60 percent of those who expressed a view as to whether the proposals would help to tackle the issues of quality and supply of medical expert witnesses in the family courts were in favour of the general thrust of the Chief Medical Officer’s report. Almost all of the national level<br />stakeholder organisations supported the main proposals – which were to establish teams within NHS trusts to provide expert evidence to the family courts, and to commission the service through a public-sector organisation. However, around half of the healthcare professionals who responded as individuals had reservations, eg:</p>\n<p>• Resources – publicity over the financial position of the NHS led respondents to doubt whether resources would be available to fund expert witness services;<br />• Time constraints, and possible conflict between a requirement to assist the courts and the teams’ clinical responsibilities;<br />• Availability of trained professionals – those involved in child protection often mentioned the difficulty in filling posts in that specialty; the shortage of consultants in child and adolescent mental health and in paediatric radiology was also a concern.</p>\n<p>These are among the issues currently being addressed by an implementation project board, the chair of which is Dr Simon Tanner, National Lead – Bearing Good Witness Programme and Regional Director of Public Health, NHS South Central.</p>",

On average, BDP products currently tend to be the cheapest ICS available at starting doses and to remain so as the daily ICS dose required increases. The exclusion of CFC-propelled products may increase the mean annual cost of both BDP and BUD, but should have no effect on the cost of MF, FP or CIC, as all products for these drugs are CFC-free. The higher cost of BUD and BDP may decrease the overall cost differences between the ICS comparators. However, it should be noted that although the use of weighted averages to calculate these costs can provide a useful way of representing the major differences between the drugs, these often conceal the wide variations in the costs of individual products containing each drug. These costs will also inevitably be sensitive to year-on-year shifts in the market share or price of individual products.</p>\n<p>There is evidence that the addition of a LABA to an ICS is potentially more clinically effective than doubling the dose of ICS alone, although consistent significant differences between the two treatment strategies are not observed for all outcome measures. The cost differences between combination therapy and ICS monotherapy are highly variable and dependent on the dose required and the particular preparations used. For the combination therapies of ICS/LABA there are potential cost savings with the use of combination inhalers compared with separate inhalers, with few differences between the two treatment strategies in terms of effects. The only exception to this cost saving is with BUD/FF at doses higher than 1200 µg/day, where separate inhaler devices can become equivalent to or cheaper than combination inhalers. The evidence regarding the relative effects of the two combination inhalers available is mixed. Neither of the two combination inhalers (FP/SAL or BUD/FF) is consistently superior in terms of treatment effect. A comparison of the costs associated with each combination therapy indicates that at low dose FP/SAL delivered via a pMDI is currently the cheapest combination inhaler. However, this is only marginally cheaper than BUD/FF delivered as a DPI. At higher doses, both the FP/SAL combination inhalers (PMDI and DPI) are marginally cheaper than BUD/FF (DPI).</p>\n<p><strong>Links to the full executive summary :<br /></strong><a href=\"http://www.hta.nhs.uk/execsumm/summ1219.shtml\">http://www.hta.nhs.uk/execsumm/summ1219.shtml</a></p>",

It suggests that there are not only policy measures that could help to protect from later personality disorder but also measures directed at recognizing and treating early cases. Policies that might reduce the risk of later antisocial behaviour include measures to reduce school exclusion, anti-bullying programmes and measures to promote preventive activities by mental health professionals. In terms of early treatment, the most effective preventive measure is likely to be better recognition and treatment of behavioural disorder, particularly conduct disorder. The paper concludes with a review of gaps in current knowledge.",

It contributes a new focus to the wealth of existing research on teenage pregnancy by locating it within the context of social disadvantage and exclusion. The review systematically examines research relating to policy initiatives aimed at tackling the social exclusion associated with unintended teenage pregnancy and young parenthood. It concludes that there are strong grounds for investing in early childhood and youth development programmes as strategies for reducing unintended teenage pregnancy rates. Happiness, enjoyment of school and ambition can all help to delay early parenthood. The available research evidence also points both to daycare and to education and career development programmes as promising ways of supporting young parents. Holistic support programmes appear to be appropriate but have not yet been shown to be effective. However, studies of young people’s views suggest many important research gaps. These include the development and evaluation of policies to promote young people’s involvement in schooling, further education and training, and to support families experiencing problems linked with social disadvantage and poverty.",

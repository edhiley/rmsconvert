    <description>Shifting inpatient care for breast cancer surgery to a day case/23-hour pathway
The initiative was organised in three phases over 2 years to test and pilot how to change clinical practice, streamline pathways and improve patient experience. The phases are outlined below.

Phase 1. The day case/23-hour breast surgical care pathway was initially designed and tested by Kingâ€Ÿs College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. 

Phase 2. This focused on spreading the pathway across the Pan Birmingham Cancer Network; testing the transferability of the pathway into different care settings such as day case units, treatment Centres and inpatient wards and building the clinical evidence base surrounding use of wound drains and drainage of seromas.

Phase 3. Focused on wider spread and coverage of the day case/23-hour pathway across England. Currently this involves 13 clinical spread networks covering 52 hospitals across the country, a third of all NHS provision.</description>

The phases are outlined below.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Phase 1. The day case/23-hour breast surgical care pathway was initially designed and tested by King?s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Phase 2. This focused on spreading the pathway across the Pan Birmingham Cancer Network; testing the transferability of the pathway into different care settings such as day case units, treatment Centres and inpatient wards and building the clinical evidence base surrounding use of wound drains and drainage of seromas.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Phase 3. Focused on wider spread and coverage of the day case/23-hour pathway across England. Currently this involves 13 clinical spread networks covering 52 hospitals across the country, a third of all NHS provision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Patient segmentation&lt;BR&gt;Each phase of the initiative included all elective breast inpatient surgery patients (both non-cancer and cancer) including major breast surgery mastectomies and wide local excisions. Scope of the redesign at this stage excluded breast reconstruction. It is intended that the 23-hour model with breast reconstruction will be tested in early 2011.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pathway scope: whole breast surgical pathway approach&lt;BR&gt;In primary care, the pathway included breast screening (20% of referrals) and GP referral, and pre-optimisation for fitness for surgery. In secondary care, the pathway comprised diagnosis and assessment, multidisciplinary team decision-making, pre-operative care, admission, intra- and post-operative care and surgical follow-up (if required), and the transfer to continuing care and treatment for cancer patients.&lt;BR&gt;Breast cancer patients are benefiting from redesign of the pathway because they can have major breast surgery and be home within a day instead of of 6 days.The new pathway has been widely welcomed by patients.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Testing delivered an improved quality service, identified productivity and efficiency gains with limited or no additional investment. Supported by NHS Improvement, the pathway is now spreading across England involving 52 NHS hospitals. If this initiative was rolled out across the country it could reduce length of stay by 50%, release 61,000 bed day capacity and potentially save £10.5m.&lt;BR&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the UK. In England, there are 34,000 new cases of female breast cancer and approximately 300 male breast cancer cases per annum (Cancer Registrations in England 2000). Redesign of the breast surgical pathway potentially benefits all patients undergoing breast surgery.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the key quality principles underpinning service redesign in cancer care is that „All patients should be on a defined patient pathway based on their tumour type and reasons for admission.? (Cancer Reform Strategy 2007, Winning principles NHS Improvement 2007). This principle underpinned the redesign of the breast surgical care pathway but will also benefit non-cancer patients requiring breast surgery.&lt;BR&gt;The redesign process involved reviewing clinical procedures, listening to patients? views and integrating the pathway between acute hospitals and the community. It challenged preconceptions surrounding clinical practice in breast cancer surgery and successfully tested mastectomies (without reconstruction) using a day case/23-hour model.&lt;BR&gt;Testing identified improvements in patient choice and in patient experience by managing expectations, reducing unnecessary waiting and valuing their time. It provided an opportunity to build an evidence base for clinical practice surrounding use of wound drains and the drainage of seromas.&lt;BR&gt;A schematic showing the day case pathway is shown in Appendix 1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

&lt;P&gt;Successful collaboration across the South West has provided opportunities to exploit volume leverage within the cardiology market and created pathways to start improving the service provision at each individual centre.&lt;BR&gt;The collaborative approach ensures aggregation, and economies of scale are combined with a once-only approach to the supplier market. Clinical engagement and support is critical to promote innovative and cost effective solutions across AGWS. A Band 6 Category Buyer is required to support this procurement work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Building on existing relationships and having effectively introduced contracting control across the network, the longer-term aim of the strategy will be to focus on service line costing of each tariff in line with the wider QIPP agenda.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The Clean Your Hands campaign has been rolled out nationally to reduce hospital-acquired infection. The pre-implementation estimate for savings from the campaign was £140 million per annum if the reduction in hospital-acquired infection rate was 0.1%. Rates of procurement of alcohol hand rub and soap have increased following the launch of the campaign.</description>

    <description>The purpose of the service is to provide: rapid assessment and direction to the most appropriate service community treatment, as an alternative to secondary care, using a podiatrist specialising in biomechanics, who will provide orthotic devices where appropriate referral to podiatric surgery, allowing a wide range of operations to be performed as day cases. Referral to secondary care continues for just over 8% of patients for whom day case care or local anaesthesia is not appropriate.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The success of the pathway has resulted in an unplanned increase in activity which has put considerable pressure on the Podiatry Service. The increased number of biomechanical referrals meant that additional staff from other clinical areas, for example, Community Podiatry, were required to undertake biomechanical assessments, resulting in longer waiting times for other follow-up treatments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

'No benefit for Caesarian delivery (CD) over vaginal delivery (VD) can be demonstrated in this review of 21 non-randomized studies.

No doubt there are women who, due to previous trauma or pelvic reconstruction, cannot risk further trauma to the sphincter and for whom CD is appropriate. There is no evidence in included studies that such women constituted a significant number of women having CD, which could lead to a bias in favor of VD, and this situation would have been excluded in most of the best studies. In any case the results of this review state that based upon current evidence, a pregnant woman cannot be told that by having a CD she can reliably avoid anal incontinence.'</description>

    <description>The Community Hospital Project involved collaborative working between an independent hospice (Thames Hospicecare) and an NHS provider (Berkshire East Community Services).
Twenty-one trained nursing staff from two community hospitals spent a week at the local hospice (two staff per week). The placements and associated education addressed values and beliefs about end of life care, communication skills, holistic assessment, advanced care planning, symptom management, and use of end of life care tools, for example, the Liverpool Care Pathway. The hospice multiprofessional team (nurses, doctors, allied health professionals and volunteers) provided teaching, mentorship and support for all secondees.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Common Core Competencies (Department of Health, 2009a), St Christopher’s Hospice (2009) and the End of Life e-learning programme (Bee-Wee, 2009) provided the basis of the secondment curriculum and experiential learning at the hospice. A competency-based workbook was used by secondees to identify individual learning needs and assess, identify and demonstrate levels of competence in end of life care when they returned to their place of work. Staff were asked to identify the changes in practice that they would implement on return to the community hospitals.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a result of the project the Liverpool Care Pathway will be implemented within the community hospitals; with continued support from the end of life care staff to further develop end of life care.&lt;BR&gt;The project targeted nursing staff and not doctors or other health care professionals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of Cochrane review stated:
'Due to some potential advantages of high dose rate intracavity brachytherapy, such as rigid immobilisation, outpatient treatment, patient convenience, accuracy of source and applicator positioning, individualised treatment with source optimisation and complete radiation protection for personnel, high dose rate intracavity brachytherapy should be considered a standard treatment strategy for patients with cervical cancer instead of low dose rate intracavity brachytherapy, especially in developing countries.'</description>

&lt;P&gt;This review included the current available evidence and showed that high dose rate intracavity brachytherapy was comparable with low dose rate intracavity brachytherapy. In the subgroup analysis there was no significant difference between high dose rate and low dose rate when considering overall survival, disease specific survival, relapse-free survival, local control rate, recurrence and metastasis and treatment related to complications for patients with clinical stages I, II and III. Therefore, we recommend the use of high dose rate intracavity brachytherapy for all clinical stages of uterine cervix cancer.’&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of Cochrane review stated: 'There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on ankle sprain or acute knee ligament injury, or on experimentally induced delayed-onset muscle soreness.

    <description>DAFNE (dose adjustment for normal eating) is a structured education programme for adults with type 1 diabetes. It provides skills to adjust insulin doses at each meal. Better long-term glycaemic control reduces the risk of long-term complications as well as reducing both diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypoglycaemia. DAFNE pays for itself within 5 years.</description>

    <title>Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety.</title>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of Cochrane review stated:
'The 27 studies included in this review do not provide any clear and unbiased evidence to support the first-line use of minocycline in the treatment of acne. Although it has been shown to be an effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris at a dose of 100 mg
per day, no study has conclusively shown any important clinical difference between the tetracycline antibiotics or other commonly used therapies. Given that it is 2.9 to 4.8 times more expensive than (oxy)tetracycline in the UK (Drug Tariff Jan 2000) depending on the formulation, the additional cost of minocycline is not justified on the basis of clinical efficacy alone.'</description>

&lt;P&gt;Similarly, there is no evidence that it is more effective in acne resistant to other therapies or that it has a faster onset of action or a more prolonged effect. Insufficient information was located to make any recommendations concerning the appropriate dose that should be used. The relative safeties of the tetracyclines have still not been adequately determined and little further information could be derived from the studies due to their inherent inability to detect rare events. Recent reviews of case reports and case series suggest that minocycline therapy for acne may be associated with a broader spectrum and a higher incidence of severe adverse drug reactions that other tetracyclines.&lt;BR&gt;The lack of a denominator in nearly all of the studies means that the risks for minocycline compared to other tetracyclines cannot be compared. Only in the case of lupus-like syndrome has it been conclusively shown that acne patients treated with minocycline are at a significantly greater risk than those given tetracycline or no treatment. Doctors should be aware that the risk of lupus-like syndrome and pigmentation increases with cumulative dose.’&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Previously, the wards were operating a 3 shifts/day system with overlaps of 1–3 hours between shifts. There were two handovers every 24 hours. In effect, for 24 hours of care, there were 28 hours of staffing and 14% of paid time spent in handovers.There was also concern that information was not always passed over from one shift to another and that this delayed discharges and possibly reduced the quality of care. This initiative means that there are fewer handovers, meaning fewer chances to fail to pass on information.

A full consultation was undertaken with staff before implementing this system. All wards across the Trust have moved from a 3 shifts/day system to a 2 shifts/day system. In some ward areas there are additional short shifts at busy times of the day. For example, on the orthopaedic elective ward there is a 07:30 to 13:30 shift for one member of staff to aid discharge.

Costs have decreased by approximately £1 million a year, with potential to improve patient care.</description>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of Cochrane review stated: 'We found no evidence that pre-transfusion medication prevents non-haemolytic transfusion reactions (NHTR). This applies regardless of the patient's history of non-haemolytic transfusion reactions and whether or not they were transfused with leukodepleted blood products.

Practically, this implies the prescription of pre-transfusion medication is not justified, unless new evidence from a large high quality trial modifies this conclusion.'</description>

    <description>A mandatory 1-hour masterclass was held for all staff who had any supervisory responsibility. The masterclass covered:

- expectations of supervisors in managing absence 
- the sickness absence policy 
- hints and tips on managing sickness 
- frequently asked questions 
- the role of occupational health 
- template letters for each stage of the sickness management process.

Routine training for sickness management is ongoing and the master class is being incorporated into a new supervisors training programme.
Monitoring is an ongoing process. The HR team started producing a monthly data set showing all individuals who had been off sick, and whether they had been referred to occupational health and/or were engaged in an HR process. This infomation was sent to senior managers so that they could identify which supervisors might need help in managing sickness. The aim was to identify the supervisors who might not be managing sickness appropriately, rather than the individuals who were absent.</description>

The aim was to identify the supervisors who might not be managing sickness appropriately, rather than the individuals who were absent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For many supervisors, the first few difficult discussions were compliance driven, but once they saw the difference it made to sickness levels on their wards and that they could spend less time managing poor attendance, many have become passionate advocates for proper absence management.&lt;BR&gt;Local targets for absence have not been set – soft targets around compliance with the process are in place, but the key driver is individual supervisors seeing the benefits in their teams.&lt;BR&gt;Next steps include implementation of a comprehensive Trust health and wellbeing strategy, which has been developed using national and local guidance.&lt;BR&gt;Within 3 months, sickness absence levels had fallen below 3.0% saving at least £500,000 per year in sickness payments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of the Cochrane review stated:
'The evidence identified no benefits or harms associated with restricting women's access to fluids and foods during labour for women at low risk of potentially requiring a general anaesthetic, although the studies did not assess women's views or feelings of control. Hence, women should have the autonomy and freedom to choose whether to eat or drink in labour, or not. Women should be able to consume what they desire and in doing so experience no adverse impact on labour, maternal or fetal outcomes. Most women seem to naturally reduce their intake as labour progresses and becomes more intense. There were no studies identified that looked at restricting fluids and food during labour for women at increased risk of requiring general anaesthesia, so restricting fluid and food intake for these women remains an unproven intervention.'</description>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of the Cochrane review stated: 'The review found no conclusive evidence of benefit for 72 to 96 hour catheter changes. Consequently, health care organisations may consider changing to a policy whereby catheters are changed only if clinically indicated. This would provide significant cost savings and would also be welcomed by patients, who would be spared the unnecessary pain of routine re-sites in the absence of clinical indications. Busy clinical staff would also reduce time spent on this intervention.'</description>

In fact, there is emerging evidence that they are not effective and can cause harm. As such, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cannot be recommended as a treatment for children with autism at this time.&lt;BR&gt;For adults, small positive effects have been seen with fewer side effects reported, but the possible risk of bias and small sample size of the trials make clear recommendations impossible at this time. Decisions about the use of SSRIs for established clinical indications that may co-occur with autism, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, and anxiety (in the case of adults), should be made on a case by case basis.&lt;BR&gt;Not all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors currently in use have been subjected to controlled trials for autism spectrum disorder. As autisim spectrum disorder causes substantial impairment, parents of children with the condition are motivated to try treatments regardless of the evidence. Nevertheless, it is important that prescribing clinicians are explicit to parents and patients about the limited evidence, discuss the risks of treatment, and discuss other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.’&lt;/pageBody&gt;&lt;/page&gt;&lt;/article&gt;]]&gt;</body>

    <description>Children are assessed for the equipment by the relevant therapist. Equipment requests are then sent to the fortnightly Scrutiny Group which comprises Trust therapy staff, SEN leads from Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council Early Years Service. The Scrutiny Group is chaired by the Strategic Therapy Lead for Children's and Young People's Services (employed by NHS Rotherham Community Health Services).
After agreeing the appropriateness of the equipment and allocating funding, the equipment is ordered by the Project Support Officer (NHS Rotherham Community Health Services). A preagreed formula developed through the work of the Scrutiny Group calculates the funding split between NHS Rotherham PCT and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. The formula is flexible to allow for the variety of requests and emerging new equipment. Criteria are based around the type of equipment, where it will be used and the therapeutic, social and educational benefits.</description>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of Cochrane review stated:
'There is insufficient evidence to recommend statins for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. In LEADe 2010, the first large-scale randomised control trial evaluating statins as a treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, the regimen of atorvastatin plus donepezil was not associated with significant benefit in clinical outcome measures over 72 weeks. When data from this trial were pooled with two smaller scale studies there was no benefit from statins seen with the primary outcome measure Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) or in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).
From ADCLT 2005 there was some evidence that atorvastatin treatment was more beneficial at six months in Alzheimer's disease patients with higher MMSE at baseline, those with an apolipoprotein E4 allele and higher cholesterol levels at baseline. This would need to be confirmed in larger scale studies.'</description>

    <description>The 'Implications for practice' section of the Cochrane review stated: 'There is evidence from a single small randomised controlled trial that tracheal gas insufflation may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants' although the data from this single small study does not give sufficient evidence to support the introduction of tracheal gas insufflation into clinical practice.

The technical requirements for performing tracheal gas insufflation (as performed in the single included study) are great, and there is no statistically significant reduction in the total duration of respiratory support or hospital stay.

    <description>A centrally-funded training programme for emergency medicine staff saw a 13-fold increase in organ donor referrals over a 4 year period in the North Thames area.  Extrapolating the resulting increase in transplant surgery would produce savings (compared to dialysis) of £150-500 million across the NHS.</description>

    <description>This initiative addresses a more efficient approach to transport for people undergoing dialysis. Southend Renal Unit provides renal services to a population of approximately 350,000 people. There are around 130 people on chronic haemodialysis. In 2008/9, transport costs for haemodialysis were Â£277,000. Patients home addresses were mapped and regrouped into closest postcode areas, and transport journeys were reconfigured accordingly. The regulation of taxi use was also closely examined. A systematic approach was used to coordinate treatment days and times. Dialysis times were adjusted to group people from close geographical areas. Mobility status was reassessed for all people using ambulance transport. Letters were sent to people receiving dialysis informing them of the proposed changes then revised transport schedules were produced.</description>

    <description>The use of alternative media (telephone, email, texting) to support people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome improves access to therapy led services for people who are unable to attend face to face appointments. Patient satisfaction was very high.  Face to face contacts were reduced where appropriate. Annual cost saving approximately £34,000.</description>
